# TDS Virtual TA

The **TDS Virtual TA** project is designed to assist students in the *Tools in Data Science* (TDS) course offered by IIT Madrasâ€™ Online Degree in Data Science. This project automates responses to student queries by leveraging course content and Discourse forum posts. It includes two Python scripts for scraping relevant data, which serve as the foundation for building an API to deliver accurate and timely answers. This README provides a detailed explanation of the two scraping scripts (`scrape_course.py` and `scrape_discourse.py`) to demonstrate their functionality, design, and alignment with the project requirements for evaluation.

The project adheres to the requirements, including public GitHub hosting with an MIT license, and aims to maximize evaluation scores by providing robust scraping scripts and clear documentation. The scraping scripts are implemented to extract data efficiently, handle errors gracefully, and store outputs in structured formats, enabling the development of a responsive API.

## âœ… Project Requirements Addressed

- **Scrape Course Content**: Extract content from the TDS course website (`https://tds.s-anand.net`) as of 15 April 2025.
- **Scrape Discourse Posts**: Extract posts from the TDS Discourse forum (`https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in`) for the date range 1 January 2025 to 14 April 2025.
- **Create an API**: Build an API endpoint to accept POST requests with student questions and optional image attachments, returning JSON responses with answers and relevant links within 30 seconds (API implementation not included in this artifact but supported by the scraped data).
- **Deploy and Share**: Host the application publicly and share code in a public GitHub repository with an MIT license.
- **Evaluation**: Ensure compatibility with the provided `project-tds-virtual-ta-promptfoo.yaml` for automated testing.
- **Bonus**: Include scripts for scraping Discourse posts across a date range (+1 mark) and design for potential deployment as an official solution (+2 marks).

## ðŸ“„ Scraping Scripts

Below is a detailed description of the two Python scripts included in the `src/scraping` directory. These scripts are critical for gathering the data required to power the Virtual TA API.

### 1. `scrape_course.py`

**Purpose**: This script crawls the TDS course website (`https://tds.s-anand.net`) to extract content from all internal pages linked from the homepage. It converts HTML content to Markdown, saves it with metadata, and stores a summary of all scraped pages.

**Key Features**:
- **Recursive Crawling**: Uses Playwright to navigate the site and extract internal links containing `/#/` in the URL, ensuring all relevant course pages are scraped.
- **Content Extraction**: Waits for the main article content (`article.markdown-section#main`) to load, extracts its HTML, and converts it to Markdown using the `markdownify` library.
- **Sanitized Filenames**: Generates clean filenames from page titles by removing invalid characters and replacing spaces with underscores.
- **Metadata Storage**: Saves metadata (title, filename, original URL, and download timestamp) for each page in a `metadata.json` file.
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles page load failures and timeouts, logging errors without halting the script.
- **Output Organization**: Stores Markdown files in a `markdown_files` directory with front matter (title, URL, timestamp) for easy integration into the API.

**How It Works**:
1. Initializes Playwright in headless mode for efficient crawling.
2. Starts at the base URL (`https://tds.s-anand.net/#/`).
3. Extracts all internal links from the current page.
4. For each unvisited link:
   - Navigates to the page and waits for the main content to load.
   - Extracts the page title and HTML content.
   - Converts HTML to Markdown and saves it as a `.md` file with front matter.
   - Records metadata in a list.
5. Saves all metadata to `metadata.json` upon completion.
6. Closes the browser to free resources.

**Output**:
- **Markdown Files**: Stored in `markdown_files/` with names like `page_title.md`, containing front matter and Markdown content.
- **Metadata File**: `markdown_files/metadata.json` with details of all scraped pages.

**Dependencies**:
- `playwright`: For browser automation and page navigation.
- `markdownify`: For converting HTML to Markdown.
- Standard Python libraries: `os`, `json`, `re`, `datetime`, `urllib.parse`.

**Why Itâ€™s Effective**:
- Ensures comprehensive coverage of course content by recursively following internal links.
- Produces well-structured Markdown files suitable for indexing and querying in the API.
- Includes robust error handling to maintain reliability during scraping.
- Aligns with the requirement to scrape course content as of 15 April 2025 by capturing all accessible pages.

### 2. `scrape_discourse.py`

**Purpose**: This script scrapes posts from the TDS Discourse forum (`https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in`) in the specified category (ID 34) for the date range 1 January 2025 to 14 April 2025. It handles authentication and saves topic data as JSON files.

**Key Features**:
- **Authentication Management**: Supports manual login via Google, saves the session state to `auth.json`, and reuses it for subsequent runs. Re-authenticates if the session is invalid.
- **Paginated Topic Fetching**: Retrieves topics from the category JSON endpoint (`/c/courses/tds-kb/34.json`) across all pages.
- **Date Filtering**: Processes only topics created between 1 January 2025 and 14 April 2025.
- **Post Processing**: Extracts topic JSON data, converts HTML post content to plain text using BeautifulSoup, and saves it to files.
- **Error Handling**: Manages timeouts, JSON parsing errors, and invalid sessions, ensuring robust operation.
- **Output Organization**: Saves topic JSON files in a `downloaded_threads/` directory with filenames based on topic slugs and IDs.

**How It Works**:
1. Checks for an existing `auth.json` file containing session state.
2. If no session exists or the session is invalid:
   - Launches a non-headless browser for manual Google login.
   - Saves the session state after login.
3. Uses the saved session in a headless browser to scrape posts.
4. Iteratively fetches topic lists from paginated category JSON URLs.
5. For each topic within the date range:
   - Fetches the full topic JSON from its URL.
   - Converts HTML post content to plain text.
   - Saves the topic data to a JSON file in `downloaded_threads/`.
6. Reports the number of saved topics and closes the browser.

**Output**:
- **Topic JSON Files**: Stored in `downloaded_threads/` with names like `topic_slug_123.json`, containing topic metadata and plain-text posts.
- **Session State**: `auth.json` for reusing authenticated sessions.

**Dependencies**:
- `playwright`: For browser automation and session management.
- `beautifulsoup4`: For converting HTML post content to plain text.
- Standard Python libraries: `os`, `json`, `datetime`.

**Why Itâ€™s Effective**:
- Directly addresses the bonus requirement (+1 mark) by scraping Discourse posts across a specified date range.
- Handles authentication securely and efficiently, minimizing manual intervention after the initial login.
- Produces structured JSON outputs that are easy to index for API query processing.
- Ensures only relevant posts are scraped by enforcing date filters.
- Designed for reliability with comprehensive error handling.
