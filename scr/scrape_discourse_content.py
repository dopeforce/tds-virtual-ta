scrape_discourse_content.py

This script provides a robust and efficient utility for downloading a GitHub repository (either a specific branch or commit) as a ZIP archive, extracting its contents, and retaining only Markdown (.md) filesâ€”excluding 'README.md' and any files containing 'sidebar' in their names. It is designed for automation and integration into content pipelines, particularly where only documentation files are needed from a repository.
Main Features:
--------------
- Downloads a GitHub repository as a ZIP file, supporting both branch and commit references.
- Securely extracts the ZIP archive, preventing path traversal vulnerabilities.
- Cleans the extracted directory tree, retaining only relevant Markdown files.
- Handles all file operations efficiently, using streaming and temporary directories for optimal performance and safety.
- Provides informative progress and error messages throughout the process.
Functions:
----------
- download_repo_zip(repo_url: str, ref: str, is_commit: bool = False, dest_path: str = None) -> str:
    Downloads a GitHub repository as a ZIP file from a specified branch or commit. Streams the download to minimize memory usage and saves the ZIP to the provided destination path. Raises errors for invalid paths or failed downloads.
- extract_repo_zip(zip_path: str, extract_to: str) -> None:
    Securely extracts the contents of a ZIP file to a specified directory. Ensures that all extracted files remain within the target directory to prevent path traversal attacks. Raises errors for invalid ZIP files or extraction issues.
- keep_only_md(root_dir: str) -> None:
    Traverses the given directory tree (bottom-up) and deletes all files except Markdown (.md) files, while also excluding 'README.md' and files containing 'sidebar' in their names (case-insensitive). Removes empty directories after file deletion.
- parse_args() -> argparse.Namespace:
    Parses command-line arguments for the script, supporting mutually exclusive options for branch or commit selection, and an optional output directory. Defaults to the 'main' branch if neither branch nor commit is specified.
- main():
    Orchestrates the entire workflow: argument parsing, ZIP download, secure extraction, moving the extracted content to the output directory, and cleaning up non-Markdown files. Handles errors and prints progress messages.
Usage Example:
--------------
    python scrape_discourse_content.py https://github.com/user/repo --branch main --output res/discourse_content
Command-Line Arguments:
-----------------------
    repo_url    : GitHub repository URL (required).
    --branch    : Branch name to download (default: "main").
    --commit    : Specific commit SHA to download (mutually exclusive with --branch).
    --output    : Output directory for extracted files (default: <repo>-<ref>).
Intended Use Cases:
-------------------
- Automated documentation extraction from GitHub repositories.
- Content filtering pipelines where only Markdown files are required.
- Secure and efficient repository archiving for offline processing.
Requirements:
-------------
- Python 3.6+
- requests
