Dear all,
I’m thrilled to share a project inspired by my experience in the *Tools in Data Science * course:
LLM Classroom Assignment Evaluator
.  This is the basic prototype.
This tool leverages Google APIs and LLMs to automate grading and feedback for Google Classroom assignments, making evaluation faster and more insightful for educators.
A heartfelt thanks to
@s.anand
, our course instructor, and TAs
@Carlton
and
@Jivraj
, whose guidance on LLM function calling and real-world applications made this project possible.
I’d love to invite contributions from this amazing community to:
Expand functionality and evaluation models.
Fix bugs and optimize workflows.
Improve documentation for broader accessibility.
The
GitHub repository
is open for forks, pull requests, and ideas. I look forward to collaborating with you all!
Update: here is a video explaining the process -

Hi Avinash,
Thats great work! I am glad you were able to use what you learnt from the course for something so practical. I hope you continue to develop and refine it, take feedback from the stakeholders who would be interested in this approach. I see a lot of potential in this project.
Kind regards
