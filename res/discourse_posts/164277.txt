Please post any questions related to
Project 1 - LLM-based Automation Agent
.
Deadline:
Sunday, February 16, 2025 6:29 PM
Update on 27 Jan 2025
:
A
sample
evaluation script for Project 1 tasks A1-A10 is available at
tools-in-data-science-public/project-1 at tds-2025-01-project-1-wip · sanand0/tools-in-data-science-public · GitHub
You can use this to validate your code for Project 1.
Please note:
This is a sample. It
WILL
change.
Don’t rely on the dataset being the same. It
WILL
change.
LLMs give different results each time they are called. Make sure:
Your code gives correct results
reliably
(i.e. try a few times)
Change the task in the evaluation script slightly to test variations
Your
AI Proxy usage
resets on 1 Feb. You have a limited budget. Utilize what you can this month.
For those who
submit their code
by Friday 31 Jan, I will run a sample evaluation and share the results.

sir
@Jivraj
after editing line 127 in datagen.py i got those  required data files. is it allowed ? also i had to run datagen.py MANUALLY(is this process also should be automatic)?

[2025-01-23T11:30:21.008Z] Jivraj Singh Shekhawat (@Jivraj: Course TA)
Hi Guddu ,
I didn’t make any changes to file and it worked for me. Can you mention what is need of making changes ?
command that I used :
uv run datagen.py 22f3002542@ds.study.iitm.ac.in --root ./data
here --root option defines the folder where you want to store generated data. by default it would try to create a folder in root directory of operating system.
Kind regards
Jivraj

getting this issue :
openai.AuthenticationError: Error code: 401 - {'error': {'message': 'Your authentication token is not from a valid issuer.', 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'param': None, 'code': 'invalid_issuer'}}

[2025-01-23T13:22:03.304Z] Jivraj Singh Shekhawat (@Jivraj: Course TA)
Hi Aishik,
Pls add context to your query, without that we won’t be able to understand, where exactly you are facing problem.
23f2005325:
openai.AuthenticationError: Error code: 401 - {'error': {'message': 'Your authentication token is not from a valid issuer.', 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'param': None, 'code': 'invalid_issuer'}}
Possible reasons for this issue:
Not using anand sir’s proxy url for sending requests.
Token not being correct.

[2025-01-25T16:20:57.111Z] Aishik Bandyopadhyay (@23f2005325)
yes I was not setting the base url to the proxy. I have fixed it thank you .

While implementing task A5, I am confused about what recent actually means in the phrase “recent log file”, mentioned under task A5, in the problem statement. This confusion arises because there are no dates corresponding to the log files. Should I consider log-0 as the most recent one? or the log-<largest_number> file? Please clarify.

do we have to do these tasks in the linux? As in some of the GA1, the linux answers only accepted. Please tell me that, do we can do it in the desktop or we have to use linux?

The bash commands are usually run in a linux machine, but you can easily run those commands in VSCode without installing any virtual machines. Download the WSL extension in VSCode and you will get a WSL terminal to work with.

Project 1 deliverables are all that matter. How you accomplish them is not very relevant. The keys to a successful Project 1 are:
Deliverables,
and
an example
of the Evaluation has been provided.
If your project runs in accordance with the Evaluation methodology then it is considered.

Please read the documentation carefully from top to bottom.
So the main question is how do you test if the script will run according to the evaluation? The whole point is for it to run not just on your system. It should be deployable anywhere on any machine. Your solution should work anywhere we test it. Thats why you package it in a docker container. How you achieve that is up to you. But if we cannot run your docker container according to the specification we have provided then it has failed this crucial test.
Kind regards

You can use any library as long as your Project 1 meets the deliverable requirements and does all the (20+) API tasks.

Hi
@Divya1
,
There won’t be any project1 page such as GA1s, there is a google form(which can be found in same page) which needs to be filled after you do project1.

Hi
@23f2005325
,
Extracting details from credit cards is sensitive, try using strong prompts or take code from LLM and execute it in script.
kind regards

Regarding Wednenday 9-10 pm live session, maybe the instructors could also discuss how to use docker as a virtual environment using maybe ollama(local llm as now there is deepseek opensource, i doubt we would need to use openai for testing, just for production(test submission)  would be enough) and also some agent(langchain, autogen, crewai) just a quick how-to on setting up and problems while setting up if possible
More resources on docker. Using docker as a virtual environment. Editing and executing code in Dockerfiles (like when you change code in src a web framework automatically reloads page(hot reload)), something along the lines of this .

Regarding Wednenday 9-10 pm live session, maybe the instructors could also discuss how to use docker as a virtual environmen
In Tuesday’s(21 January) session we had discussed docker towards ending of session.
What was discussed in that live session regarding docker:
Search for existing containers on repositories such as dockerhub.
Pull an existing docker image.
Run that image inside a container.
Enter to that container and modify something(such as installing python inside a ubuntu container, for customization or create some file)
Once done you can commit it.
And push customized container’s image to docker hub.
Regarding local models running for project1, it’s a good idea, we will see if it’s possible to discuss in session.

Please do very carefully all things mentioned in the Deliverables as well as look at the Evaluation Section.

We had a session on 28th Jan introducing all the important aspects of Project.
If you do not do everything exactly as mentioned
especially the pre - requisites
mentioned in the Evaluation section you will get 0 in the project and
there will be no appeal
for failing to meet the pre - requisites of the evaluation criteria.
In order for us to evaluate the project you have to provide the deliverables mentioned above.

Hi
@JoelJeffrey
,
Filepath is unique for every file, which needs to be inserted to json file.

[2025-01-31T06:55:55.139Z] Joel Jeffrey (@JoelJeffrey)
Ok. So just to confirm, since there are files with the same name, the json file should map the filepath and not the filename to the title right?

no crewai, it takes really long i put time out for 300 secs(in run(task:str) in evaluate.py) still sometimes its not enough. I’ll try with autogen next and then langchain

result after running evaluate.py:

why sir
@Jivraj
@Saransh_Saini
what is the problem here??
please do a live session of complete project process with one or two tasks if possible

[2025-01-31T09:04:35.954Z] Carlton D'Silva (@carlton: Regular)
Hi Guddu,
We are planning several project sessions in order to show the workflow of creating a successful project.
Although you are returning a 200 ok, the get request file must match the expectation. In other words after running the first task for example, has the new format.md been formatted correctly and matches the expected output.
In this case you would write out the the
expected
variable in the
evaluate.py
and see if
result
variable matches the
expected
. Then you can figure out what went wrong.
Kind regards

the model keeps wrong answer, it says uvicorn for uv and has no info on how to run uv even after explicitly giving instructions(basically an older model) , basic “ls” command is also wrong, among other things. You can check your logs with respect to my api key.
Do you think we could access a better model?
Maybe Download Deepseek 70b or even 671b and create an api while y’all run the model locally, in the long it would be cheaper for the course?
because the model doesn’t know basic commands after telling how to do it.
So if the model gives us wrong commands 2/3 times then how would we even solve the question.
I spent a week on this just saying

Hello, I recently started working on the project. I understood how to do all the phase A tasks on a high level but I’m struggling to start the implementation of the first task in phase A. I’m confused mainly about how the /data directory is supposed to be created, I don’t know how to generate the data and a little confused about the output formats. I would appreciate if I could get in contact with anyone who could guide me in the right direction.

Hello everyone,
@s.anand
@carlton
I had a few queries regarding the project;
I am preloading my docker image with uv and generating the /data files when the container is ran. For task A1, I am automating my server to remove the /data directory that’s already present and run datagen.py again. Is this fine?
For /read endpoint, is there a standard for parameters like “path=/data/format.md” or the parameter could be a plain english sentence like “path=show the data in format.md”?
Are we concerned about what’s shown on the console if I run a /run command as long as it gets the job done?
For tasks A1-10, are the file paths provided in the project doc standard or even they’re flexible? Ex. “Count the number of Wednesdays in file /data/format.md, and write just the number to /data/out.txt”

- AI Proxy is working and you
did
get the result. You can ignore any
costError
. It won’t happen in the future anyway.
What’s happening?
I was trying to generate a unique hash for each request, as a precursor to caching requests. But I made a mistake in the code. Specifically,
crypto.createHash
is not supported in CloudFlare.
I fixed that
by removing this. I’ll introduce caching later if required.

A query regarding the task description in the query given to LLM for phase A.
For task A3, we have been asked to count wednesdays and the python file corresponding to A3 does count for wednesday alone. However the example says the LLM might be asked to count Sundays or other days. Should we be modifying task A3 code? Or was that just an example and only Wednesdays would need to be counted?

Tasks in Phase A are defined but that does not mean it has to do one precise thing. If that was the case then there is no use for an LLM.
Your application should be able to take parse the input and be able to run commands that do similar things in parameterised fashion. It could be Wednesdays or Sundays or it might be in Arabic days or anything. So coding to precisely do something very specific is not the goal.
The program has to be intelligent to do a certain type or class of tasks.
We had a session introducing project. Week 3 session 1. But we will have a more hands on session on Tuesday.

Will there be evaluation script for tasks in group B also?
Some questions about ‘B’ group tasks:
Q1: For the following tasks (B5, B7, B9, and B10) tasks, how will input files be provided? Will it be URL or will
datagen.py
also generate files for these?
Q2: For the above tasks as well as for B6 ( Extract data from (i.e. scrape) a website), how should output be returned?
Q3: In task B8, for transcribing audio file, which Python package is recommended or do we need to use OpenAI API?
B5. Run a SQL query on a SQLite or DuckDB database
B7. Compress or resize an image
B8. Transcribe audio from an MP3 file
B9. Convert Markdown to HTML
B10. Write an API endpoint that filters a CSV file and returns JSON data

Update: 27 Feb 2025
:
Sir, does this mean 27th is submission deadline?

[2025-02-10T02:01:43.833Z] Carlton D'Silva (@carlton: Regular)
Hi Aindree,
No its a typo (and will be corrected soon). In the context of what was written it clearly means it was
updated
on 27th January. The update being that the evaluation.py file was provided so that you could test your code against it.
Thanks for bringing it to our attention.
Kind regards

Hi
This would be only for a selected few questions right because say for the credit card question, where the LLM is involved, to get the card number itself, we have to give a fine-tuned and strong query.

I have done the a1 to a10 task and tried querying through localhost and its working fine basically all these ten steps but dont know whether its enough or not. also steps in phase B i am confused that should we create separate endpoints for these tasks or should it be with same /run endpoint and query. then will the input be random by any user. what about the output . where should it be given. phase b needs more explanation.

Hi
@carlton
@Jivraj
Facing some issues in running my project. Taking an example of the Phase A - A3 task.
I am able to read my files through the GET/read/data/dates.txt query.
I am also able to use the count_wednesdays function through the POST/run task/count_wednesdays.
But when I am entering a query such as “count_wednesdays in data/dates.txt” I am unable to get a response.

Hi Andrew,
You have done a great job with the Phase A tasks. Very methodical, well structured, logical and even incorporates (unnecessarily) two different ways of evaluating its performance via local llm or the project proxy.
I just want to forewarn you (and others who are tempted to just blindly copy and paste) that evaluate.py is not meant to give you an exact expectation of what prompts will be sent to your application.
In other words getting 10/10 in
evaluate.py
does NOT guarantee 10/10 or even 5/10  or 1/10 in the real evaluation.
So do not write your code so rigidly that it will only work in the very strict interpretation of
evaluate.py
. It has always been meant to give you a feel for what to aim for. Your code should be flexible enough to deal with the general
idea
of the task.
That said,
evaluate.py
is a good way to know what to expect. Some of Phase A tasks although given a detailed specification in the project description, will still be given challenging prompts (i.e. hard difficulty, and requires some clever self correcting mechanism). Some of the tasks will be given straight forward prompt (i.e. easy for your application).  Some of the tasks will be given with some level of parameterisation that deviates from the strict interpretation (i.e. medium difficulty).
Hope that helps with how you deal with Phase B tasks (and making your Phase A more robust to a stronger evaluation.)
A word of caution:
(i.e. this is just some advice, not a set in stone recommendation)
Your requirements.txt is massive. If your code does not execute a task (
possibly your first task
) within 20 seconds (on our server) then it will fail that task. You might want to consider a dynamic, flexible way of installing only required libraries when necessary and keeping the image footprint small and efficient, as we will necessarily have limits on how big we allow images to grow since we have to run and evaluate hundreds of images automatically.
Kind regards

Is anyone actively monitoring the Discourse page? I have been raising this issue for the past few days, but there has been no response. Does this mean the TAs are not addressing students’ concerns?
I am encountering the following error while running my project with these LLM endpoints:
https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions
https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings
This issue is blocking my progress, and I urgently need assistance to resolve it. Kindly provide guidance or suggest a solution at the earliest.
Looking forward to your response.
Thanks,

I am not able to understand how to do the Project 1. The date is also very near.
The problem I am facing is, When I did the Modules the page was different, but now in the Project 1 I am not getting any section to submit the project.
Please let me know where are the questions and how tot submit that.

This where I need help, i tried doing with agentic framework but i failed with the model in llm proxy, which was highly suspect because, that model should have known what the uv framework but it seemed to me to be outdated. Hence executing code Interpreter tools failed as the model gave outdated code. I have raised this issue before
Hence i moved to function calling, using local llms as cost-effective solution and it was quite robust.
I just need to understand how the function should be general, maybe 2-3 tasks you could provide the general description along with all the ways one would query the agent llm(ie our project). This general function is what i need help with. Please kindly do the needful.

Hi Telvin
You have run out of tokens. Thats what the message is saying. You ran out 3 days ago. It was clearly mentioned that the limit is $1. You have exceeded $2.
Screenshot 2025-02-11 at 3.36.50 pm
2078×1276 305 KB
In our current internal build of project 1, we have yet to exceed $0.50
As to whether it can be renewed is something we have still not yet decided, because the question you have raised equally would apply to everyone. Raising it for you means raising it for everyone. $1 for everyone equals raising it by $1600+
(i.e Rs 1.39 Lakhs)
for us!
The budget question then involves more than one person. It also involves the BS Team Operations and not just the TDS team and therefore instead of responding with a response that is not useful, we typically try to solve the problem first and then respond.
In short we are working on it. But as we have mentioned repeatedly in our sessions, use APIs efficiently, thats part of the skill. As soon as we have a resolution we will inform everyone via an announcement and an email.
Kind regards

Every request you send, gives you a response back with exactly how much that request cost. So you can track your usage.

[2025-02-11T11:08:19.962Z] Telvin Varghese (@22f2001640)
I’m aware of that. I’ve mostly noticed a cost of $0.0003 per request, so I haven’t been tracking my total monthly expenses. Moving forward, I’ll keep a record of the cost for each request. Also, do strong prompts impact the overall cost?

If I am not wrong, both the expected and actual result contain the same entries. It is just that the ordering is different. The expected result also doesnt follow any particular format (so does the actual result).
Kindly advise on this

For the task - *
B10
. Write an API endpoint that filters a CSV file and returns JSON data
Do we have to handle prompts for converting CSV to JSON or for writing an endpoint for doing so?

Dear Instructors (
@carlton
,
@iamprasna
):
Confirming, just to be needfully pedantic:
It will
solely
be the responsibility of the Project Evaluator (human or machine) to parse the correct
AIPROXY_TOKEN
generated against my IITM email ID (presumably, per some database which holds all such generated
AIPROXY_TOKEN
s of the students who have generated one); and the correct
$IMAGE_NAME
(to-be-submitted by myself in the Project Submission Google Form) in
podman run $IMAGE_NAME -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000
, correct?
Asking this seemingly obvious question, as (apparently) the actual
AIPROXY_TOKEN
is not to be included anywhere in the code, or the repository, or the dockerfile.

[2025-02-12T09:51:42.226Z] Adithya S (@Adithya)
I am also facing the same issue, just that the ordering is different.
Sorting by keys also didn’t help.
Please help on this

sir will the tasks of Phase A and Phase B change? like currently do we need to make llm write the code for all tasks dynamically or can we write a pre defined python code to execute tasks after the llm parses the task and runs python code

That error is usually if you are using the wrong endpoint (ie. using open ai libraries instead of sending requests to aiproxy).
Without seeing the request its hard to tell you what the cause of the error is.

could you please help me out on how to start with TDS Project-1, as I am stuck at the moment and don’t know where to start from. This project is very much unfamiliar for me and I need some guidance on how to start with it. It would be really great if you could provide some help through resources/materials/videos and help me complete the project. Thanks in advance!

My final docker image size is coming 1.25 gb, I am using the ubuntu base image as I thought it would be appropriate given the tasks. Is it ok with that size?
PS - Also I would be running out of token if I need to test again with some other base image now.

I could pull it down to 610 mb, using python:3.9-slim now, but there are some essential libraries that is needed which is taking up the space…will it be ok? I mean installing on the go with uv might lead to timeout during evaluation…

Sir in main.py file I’m defining task with different variables . But in evaluate.py tasks are defined by different variables to test and when I’m testing it using python evaluate.py it returns unsuccessful . I’m testing all my tasks of main.py with Postman it returns successful.
My query is that how the tasks get evaluated and do i need to change my variables in main.py ? And what are the other things i have to change.
Also plss update evaluate.py fie with phase B tasks

Hi instructors and TAs,
For the different tasks in Phase B, I don’t have a clear idea of what type of a response you expect.
eg.
Run a SQL query on a SQLite or DuckDB database & Extract data from (i.e. scrape) a website & Transcribe audio from an MP3 file - Do you want the query’s response on an output file like A10? or as a response?
I understand that these are broad problems you except us to solve, but it would be helpful to know what type of response you would require.
Thanks,

Hi,
Pls tell us how to use evaluate.py script to check our codes

Output specifications will be detailed in the “task” sent to the endpoint.
Phase B is meant to be vague because if you can solve it, without an elaborate and gratuitous use of gpt function calling, then you can actually solve
all tasks using the same function

Hello sir,
Is yesterday’s session not uploaded to YouTube yet ?
I couldn’t find it in calendar either… It will be very helpful if you (or anyone else) could provide yesterday session’s recording’s link…

I tried cutting it down further but it is affecting the functionality, this is the best I can do, i.e., 610 mb
@carlton
@Jivraj
will it be ok? Actually I developed it in a way that require some of the essential dependencies and at this point of time it would be dangerous to alter the way of handling it as I am running short of AIProxy Token credits.
Earlier when I asked this:
21f2000709:
Any tentative size cutoff for the docker image?
I could have altered my way of handling dependencies but at that point of time there was no clear numbers.
I request you to please allow this time around with this size…

Could you please consider extending the submission date of Assignment 5 (it is 16th Feb right now). We are very busy with the project.
And assignment 6 submission date is much later: 9th of March.

Hi
@Rishabh2
What exactly you mean by variables?  only one argument is required for running
evaluate.py
that’s an email address.
You need to download both
evaluate.py
and
datagen.py
in same folder and then execute
evaluate.py
using uv.
uv run evaluate.py --email $any_email
.
For phase B

Hi
@23f1002382
This is the classic case where you use Prompt engineering to solve your problems. I assume you have already achieved your answers, but I want to clarify this for someone who is facing this problem.
The thing is GPT-4o-mini is intelligent enough to understand what kind of task you are asking it do, and extracting Credit Card info from an image is one of the many prohibited tasks.
What you can do is,
try to fool it using itself.
Just ask ChatGPT to generate a prompt that would be capable of fooling itself into extracting out that credit card info. I was capable of doing it after pretending to be a working on a Cyber Security project, and other fake details which ChatGPT itself provided me with.

Things to be checked at your end.
1.
podman run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME
works fine
2.  Above command will start 8000 server so use evaluate.py to test if things are working as expected.

Command to run the image in the docs, seemed to have some error,
The command:
podman run $IMAGE_NAME -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000
gives the error:
crun: executable file `-e` not found in $PATH: No such file or directory: OCI runtime attempted to invoke a command that was not found
However the correct command seems to be:
podman run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN="$AIPROXY_TOKEN" -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME
This works totally fine.

One final question
@Jivraj

, will our projects be evaluated with our
AIPROXY_TOKEN
or a different one.
Because my project is done but for evaluation if my
AIPROXY_TOKEN
is used, it might be out of credits.

While running the evaluation.py i am facing several issues because my output isnt strictly adhering sometimes to it will the checking be on such a basis only
for example in A3

“129”
this is the error i get while it is the function in eval.py checking problem as it gets response as text and doesnt strip (“”)

Hi
@carlton
sir! Is this video (Week-5 Session-3) the continuation video from the previous session (Week-5 Session-1), since the Session-2 video has not been recorded and uploaded. I am totally relying on these videos to complete the project sir. Please help me out!

[2025-02-14T08:04:25.977Z] Andrew David (@23f1002382)
offical answer is you dont, you let run it in docker and it would apparently work , im not there yet, bus as of of now , create your docker image and start testing there

@Saransh_Saini
sir,
I’m getting the following error while post mapping, I couldn’t able to fix it.
I’m getting status code as 400 from the llm api response. How to fix it sir?
"json": {
        "message": "Invalid JSON body: SyntaxError: Unexpected token 'm', \"model=gpt-\"... is not valid JSON"
    }

[2025-02-14T08:35:17.405Z] Jivraj Singh Shekhawat (@Jivraj: Course TA)
There is some problem with the json that you are using.
Try to debug it with GPT.

Hello
@carlton
@Jivraj
@Saransh_Saini
sir, I have implemented the code for B3 & B6 but unfortunately as per the instructions given in project for B3 & B6 —
B6
. Extract data from (i.e. scrape) a website
B3
. Fetch data from an API and save it
They are almost similar and it’s getting confusing in both cases, it’s given output based on B3 and not reading the input for B6, so could you please help me out with this?
Is anyone else facing this or a similar issue?

[2025-02-14T09:27:49.421Z] Jivraj Singh Shekhawat (@Jivraj: Course TA)
Two solutions
give proper permissions.
use docker containers this is what we will test on.
I would prefer 2nd approach

[2025-02-14T09:31:58.136Z] Jivraj Singh Shekhawat (@Jivraj: Course TA)
For B tasks use LLM to write code on the fly and execute it, use better prompts. In evaluation script detailed task will be provided with what data needs to be scraped, endpoints, parameters, etc.

i cant send long prompts then what is the point?

[2025-02-14T09:45:59.531Z] Andrew David (@23f1002382)
local llm also we cant use you because you have some limit on file size, we send long prompt also it doesn’t work xD . What do we do?

Hi,
If you read these questions carefully then they are not similar, one is asking you to extract data from a webpage, meaning you have to do something related to the HTML code. And the other is simply sending a request to a given endpoint.

Hi
@carlton
@Saransh_Saini
@Jivraj
,
In task A6
Find all Markdown (
.md
) files in
/data/docs/
. For each file, extract the first occurrance of each H1 (i.e. a line starting with
#
). Create an index file
/data/docs/index.json
that maps each filename (without the
/data/docs/
prefix) to its title (e.g.
{"README.md": "Home", "path/to/large-language-models.md": "Large Language Models", ...}
).
Here expected output JSON “key” is file name or file path without prefix /data/docs/ as prompt is bit confusing . when “path/to/large-language-models.md” is given in example is actually referring to file path or filename itself is “path/to/large-language-models.md”.

[2025-02-14T11:44:32.114Z] Saransh Saini (@Saransh_Saini: Course TA)
This can easily be checked by runing the evaluate.py file.
Anyways, a file present in data/docs/folder_a/folder_b/md_file should be folder_a/folder_b/md_file as key.

For as task description like this
Write the # of Thursdays in
/data/extracts.txt
into
/data/extracts-count.txt
I have given the prompt in such detail to the LLM but it is still not able to understand the task because of the “#” symbol. The task is getting truncated even before it reaches to the LLM.
Can anyone help me on this because I have tried so many things to fix this but nothing seems to help.

Hi
@Jivraj

@carlton
sir,
I have created a docker file and run the application but it’s throwing error for
A2 task
No such file or directory: ‘npx’
Do i need give the node install in docker file?

@Jivraj
sir i have tried to solve the A1. when I want to check the solution we are asked for the datagen module as the evaluate.py have
’
''from datagen import (
    get_markdown,
    get_dates,
    get_contacts,
    get_logs,
    get_docs,
    get_email,
    get_credit_card,
    get_comments,
    get_tickets,
)
'''
so do we need to download the datagen.py in the local system first…
Or it should be the part of the automation only…

I am getting internal server error for task A1, I have been trying for a long time. It may be possible that i have issues with my ai_proxy token thus tell how to properly set the taken.

[2025-02-14T14:05:45.308Z] Saniya Naaz (@23f2002592)
Yes I know that but LLM does not know that # indicates number. And no prompt is fixing this issue because the task has to be passed as query parameter and by the time LLM reads the task, it is already half gone due to #.

Okay, actually when i tried with local, i’m facing path error
./data/format.md
[WinError 2] The system cannot find the file specified
So that’s why i moved to docker but there also i’m getting error for A2.

[2025-02-14T14:28:35.283Z] Daksh Agarwal (@daksh76)
you should manually check if the file really exists or not because i think the code and the folder where datagen.py is downloading files(data folder) are different

[2025-02-14T14:30:50.228Z] Arulvadivelan V (@23f2005419)
yes yes i moved the folder to current working directory

[2025-02-14T14:42:57.529Z] Carlton D'Silva (@carlton: Regular)
If you are using the function calling approach, you could just parse the ‘#’ and change it to ‘number’ and then send the prompt to the llm for that particular task.
Or another approach is tell the llm,
If you ever see the phrase ‘count the # of’ in a task, please interpret it as ‘count the number of’. For example
Count the # of Fridays means
Count the number of Fridays

}
It clearly says in your error message:
Invalid value: ‘json’
if you look at the “type” key in your response_format variable at the top,
the value cannot be “json”
The error is telling you what the supported values are
‘json_object’, ‘json_schema’, and ‘text’
Since you are defining a schema the correct value should be ‘json_schema’
So therefore you should change
"type": "json"
to
"type": "json_schema"
If you have trouble constructing Json schemas,
either feed it to gpt and have it correct it (along with your error) or please go over Module 3, in particular
https://tds.s-anand.net/#/llm-text-extraction
There is a clear example you can use as a template. We use the same one as a template when we do it in the sessions. That way you will make less errors.
Kind regards

[2025-02-14T15:24:08.470Z] Carlton D'Silva (@carlton: Regular)
Please read the deliverables and evalute section.
datagen.py and evaluate.py were for only for your testing purposes so that you have an idea of the workflow and how the evaluation works. They are NOT part of your project submission.
Only DO what the project page tells you in the deliverables and evalute sections.

Hey
@carlton
@Jivraj
, I actually submitted the project already in the morning,
I included all the deliverables and things mentioned in the evaluation section.
But since I was actively testing with the -
datagen.py
and
evaluate.py
, I forgot to remove them before submission.
However these files do not play a role in my project execution in any way, they just sit idle. Will there be any issue?

This indicates your task execution returns  “HTTP/1.1 200 OK” but the execution doesn’t creates the required file in the given location that the evaluation script is requesting.

"tools": [{"type": "function", "function": schema} for schema in function_schema]

[2025-02-15T03:42:16.807Z] Lalith Seervi (@23f2002205)
i think you have to run the following command
uv run datagen.py <your_email> --root ./data
try to include --root ./data in your code

[2025-02-15T03:47:05.826Z] Lalith Seervi (@23f2002205)
sorry i forgot the change the name of function_schema to tools please you do that

Hello,
just a silly question, if my code runs well in docker environment with
/data
in root directory, will it be fine ?
or should i keep the relative
./data
directory like in the lecture ?
Thanks

[2025-02-15T04:22:25.373Z] Carlton D'Silva (@carlton: Regular)
The reason in the lecture they were using ./data was because they were debugging in their local machine not in the docker.
For the docker image (the official submission) you must use /data.
It is a clear requirement mentioned in the project page.
Thats why it works fine when you use it in the docker image.
Kind regards

same issue happening with me even though working for last whole week only got 4 correct . please extend some time so we can complete the project as weekends are the time when we get a day off from our primary college and can work with full attention on this project.

[2025-02-15T08:59:45.643Z] JAIDEEP M (@Jaideep)
it usually happens in some GNU/Linux OS. since you are using some distribution based on Debian namely Ubuntu or whatever try doing sudo apt install python-packagename (replace package name with fastapi for fastapi)
then it works. It usually happens due to manual intervention with pip3 the user might break some system dependencies which require some python3 package. No need to worry about it.
Another Fix: try using a virtual environment which is highly suggested since there is no chance for you to interfere with the system packages.
create a venv using python3 -m venv name_of_venv
add this line to your .bashrc in ~ folder as source /path/to/your/venv/location
and run source .bashrc. This time no error occurs as you do everything in your virtual environment you can install anything python3 package using pip3 install package name.
It even happened for me

sir  do i have to put env file in docker

[2025-02-15T12:23:41.857Z] Tanush Tambe (@22f3002248)
you have to give the
AIPROXY_TOKEN
to the evaluate.py by either
bash -
export AIPROXY_TOKEN="your token"
or
powershell -
$env:AIPROXY_TOKEN="your token"
the evaluate.py file takes the token to send request to embedding end point for processing.
so you have to set
AIPROXY_TOKEN
in both terminals
i.e. app.py and evaluate.py teminals

in Phase be tasks do we have to store the output in files or just return it in the response
When I call my some of my endpoints using post man or CURL they work but if I run the evaluate.py it throws an error, this I think is a bug in the eval.py file.
any idea about these ?

You are using API_KEY = os.getenv(“AI_PROXY_TOKEN”) but it should be AIPROXY_TOKEN.

No don’t do that, just follow the procedure.
Two problems with keeping token in file.
It will become public after you push to github.
While running evaluation script after submission your token might run out of credits.

Hi ,
I am trying to build using both docker and podman but it failed on both. I have watched many videos trying to resolve this adn also chatgpt in order to resolve the issue but it seems to persist. I even uninstalled and reinstalled both podman and doceker multiple times but no help.
When i run command docker build -t ___________ .
the error that comes is :

Even tried getting python:3.12-slim separatly and trying again but that also didn’t work.
I think there is some problem in getting python:3.12-slim as the build always stops at this.
on asking ChatGPT it shows that some DNS or network issue is there. I even tried all the remedy that was provided on creating custom network etc. but this was also of no use
Kindly help me finding solution to this and pls mention any other assistance I may require to get this running

A8 * `/data/credit-card.png` contains a credit card number. Pass the image to an LLM, have it extract the card number, and write it without spaces to `/data/credit-card.txt
- in this task i assume prompt can ask for credit card number or other details like cvv and name.
My question is, whether my system should allow prompt that CVV or or such info ? or should give it ?

Previously I asked for some more credits to test my project. I got an email stating I have been provided with a new token but I think I got that same token again, not a new one. I still cant send request to the AIPROXY. Please help.
Do I need to submit the docker image name with the tag or without the tag? I submitted it before without the tag. Now i see that I have tagged the image with as v1 but I cant submit the form due to pattern matching problems. Should i submit again after tagging it with :latest ?

When I run my docker image using

Task A2 fails as the podman container is unable to find npx.
Running the same image using

works fine and Task A2 passes. I can’t understand why this is happening.
I also ran the image in both docker and podman in interactive mode as show in the below snippet from terminal.

Here’s how to prompt folks. Just do what
@carlton
mentioned in today’s live session (the 5 hour marathon) and you should be good for Project-1!

Most people are still prompting wrong.

I've found this framework, which was even shared by OpenAI President Greg Brockman.

Here’s how it works:

sir I am noticing a pattern, that when I am running the datagen first. And then using the evaluate.py, then I am getting the A2 right.
But running the evaluation.py for the 2nd time cause the A2 to fail…
Probabbly Because the file in the data folder gets upated should I worry for that…

[2025-02-16T05:21:27.713Z] Jayesh Bansal (@Jayeshbansal)
in the phase B, we have no idea about how many arguments are there, so should we make every function mapping with 2 arguments ( 1 containing the input location and other containing output location) or should we take the parameters in some other way

[2025-02-16T06:21:36.637Z] Carlton D'Silva (@carlton: Regular)
There has been an outage in some parts of the country related to cloudflare servers. What helped some students (and us) is using a completely different network eg. instead of using your home wifi, use mobile internet, since they go through a different DNS and this sometimes works.
Kind regards

Hello
@carlton
Sir,
While running evaluate.py , I have observed that the expected  and actual output is having difference like “\n” then also it marks task as fail.
eg:
EXPECTED:
Cover west give likely individual though question inside. System many human plant card among provide. Large former seek mouth there long.
Attention officer successful. Us population the true show.
Real cold if play side wind affect. Street cause investment receive have miss page station.

Difficult yourself build increase back put others.
Although artist operation thing skin lead. Billion deep measure down adult suggest. Anything action start artist when first.
Whole way know down. Music machine trip father rather.
Must medical bad law issue.
Someone explain seven maintain wrong day factor property.
RESULT:
“Cover west give likely individual though question inside. System many human plant card among provide. Large former seek mouth there long.\nAttention officer successful.

A5 FAILED
Will this be considered as failure in actual evaluation as well or will this be taken care in actual evaluation?

Use following as first parameter of
subprocess.run()
to create
data/
directory inside your project instead of C: drive
["uv", "run", script_url, user_email, "--root", "./data"]
Also, you don’t need to download to script, you can directly run it from the url.

[2025-02-16T10:33:45.101Z] Aditya Kumar Sahu (@Aditya_Sahu)
The reason for error is
evaluate.py
is trying to import
datagen.py
which doesn’t exist in your system. I’ll suggest download both the files, keep them in same folder and run
evaluate.py
from your computer

[2025-02-16T10:35:51.852Z] Monisha M (@23f3002091)

my result- { “budget.md”: “Success easy same main modern doctor.”,

Check the file once, there is a possibility that it’s either fetching a comment or the second heading. Refactor your prompt to search only for the First Heading, specify it explixitly.

This is happening because evaluate.py is unable to fetch your API Key from the environment variables. Create a new variable and set it’s value to your API Key then try.

[2025-02-16T13:22:14.284Z] Manav Singh (@Flibon)
Hi everyone,
I’m running into an issue with the AI Proxy embeddings endpoint while executing the A9 task. Every time I send a POST request to:
bash
Copy
https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings
I receive a
401 Unauthorized
response. This, in turn, causes my code to fail with a
KeyError: 'data'
because the expected JSON response doesn’t include the
"data"
key.
What I’ve Tried
Token Verification:
I’m using the
AIPROXY_TOKEN
obtained by logging in at
aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev
with my IITM email.
The token is passed in the header as follows:
python
Copy
"Authorization": f"Bearer {AIPROXY_TOKEN}"
I added debug prints to confirm that the token is being used correctly (printing the first few characters).
API Request Details:
The request includes the correct
Content-Type: application/json
header.
The payload is set as:
json
Copy
{"model": "text-embedding-3-small", "input": ["Test"]}
Despite this, the response status is consistently 401 Unauthorized.
Debug Output:
Here’s a snippet of the debug output:
bash
Copy
HTTP Request: POST https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings "HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized"
🔴 A9 failed: 'data'
This confirms that the issue is with the authentication rather than our processing logic.
What I Suspect
The token may be invalid, expired, or misconfigured.
There could be changes in the token permissions or endpoint requirements that I’m not aware of.
Alternatively, there might be an issue on the server side with token validation.
Request for Help
Has anyone else encountered this issue recently? Could someone verify if there are any changes to the authentication requirements for the embeddings endpoint? Any insights or updated instructions on how to ensure the token is valid and has the proper permissions would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks in advance for your assistance!

Should I ask for the SQL data base. Or the agent should be smart enough to find the required database…

I had a question on evaluation by the course team. To test that my application would run everywhere, I first deleted all images from my local machine using
podman rmi -a
and then ran
podman run --rm -p 8000:8000 -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN $IMAGE_NAME
with the appropriate variables set. This is as per the instructions provided
here
. But this gave me the following error:
Error: short-name "freshbash/dataworks-agent" did not resolve to an alias and no unqualified-search registries are defined in "/etc/containers/registries.conf
The above is the format in which we have to provide the image name in the Google form. So, I was confused whether this would succeed during actual evaluation.
The only way its working right now is when I specify the image name to be
docker.io/freshbash/dataworks-agent
I’m not yet very good with how containers work so some insights would be very helpful. Thanks!

Is it an issue with the spelling of dockerfile since I have submitted it in all small case as ‘dockerfile’. It was showing the score when I checked with the evaluate.py that was provided by iitm.
Shall I just change the name of the file from ‘dockerfile’ to ‘Dockerfile’ in github repository of mine or is there anything else that is needed to detect the Dockerfile?

@Saransh_Saini
Thank you all for this wonderful project. Coming from a non-coding background, I have learned a lot new things throughout this project building process.
@carlton
Sir, yesterday’s session provided valuable insights into Method 1 (prompt engineering) for dynamically handling tasks. I was able to develop an application using this approach; however, due to submission time constraints, I could not verify all tasks (my bad). While I tested some tasks and found the results to be highly accurate, I was unable to validate everything thoroughly.
Therefore, I submitted the function-calling approach (Method 2) instead.
I sincerely appreciate everyone’s guidance and support.

[2025-02-16T16:09:36.850Z] 23f3001356 (@ShahbaazSingh)

Your LLM app should be designed like it can give desire result based on task desc at run endpoint, and that result should be accessible at read endpoint.
Evaluation file just for reference to check how things works and it works for phase A tasks only. Also ensure datagen.py file and evaluation.py file are latest. There is one issue in evaluation.py file for task A1,  link of datagen.py file not correct, rectify that link. Even it corrected in GitHub repo file but when I download that raw file in local system it takes back previous link.

Dear Sir,
I am writing to you in a state of distress and humility. An unfortunate mistake on my part has led to the upload of an incorrect Docker image link. When I checked the authenticity of the link, it showed an error, even though the GitHub repository link is functioning perfectly.
I have poured my heart and soul into this project, dedicating countless hours and sleepless nights to ensure its success. The project has successfully passed both Test A and Test B, and I was thrilled to see my hard work paying off. However, this single error has left me devastated.
I am pleading with you, with all my heart, to allow me to correct this mistake by updating the Docker image link. Alternatively, I humbly request that my application be reviewed directly through GitHub. Please consider this an exception, as I have worked tirelessly over the past two weeks to create an application that is 890 lines long.
I beg for your understanding and leniency in this matter. This project means the world to me, and I am genuinely sobbing over this setback.
Thank you for considering my heartfelt request.
Sincerely,
Rishit Jain

I don’t think the project is too difficult to implement—it’s essentially a simple HTTP API for an AI agent that reads a task, converts it into parameters, and passes those parameters to specific functions to complete the task. However, the instructions in the project question aren’t very clear. Before the session, I am unable to fully understand the question. It took me almost an entire day just to understand what we need to do.
Sir Could you provide test cases or a sample answer for Phase B?

sorry to disturb you, project1 deadline is over.
I made a mistake in my project. In my call llm function i set some payload instead of default for open ai api call like max token, temp. , n, stop etc.
Due to this, some tasks may fail especially credit card image task will fail 100%, if possible can i just remove that payload from git hub repository . or you can check this call llm function present in my task_handler.py file of my repository.
I found this issue after deadline. If possible consider this request. I never engaged in a project or course like for this one. I love this project genuinely.

@TheVishal
EDIT: Create a new docker image with the mistaken image name , so when they pull image from repo, that image with the wrong name also gets pulled.
what to do
push a new image with the mistaken name, so in your repo there will be two images
how will this help?
since you are unsure, which image link you posted, you can be sure that even you had a mistake in link, a new image will exist with the wrong name after you push another image
@all
use this to update your image even after submission, as now they only validate the images, they do not pull it so you can edit your project and add more functionality if they release the code solutiion

I really appreciate the idea of open internet type of evaluations, wherein, you implement things without any constraints, learning for the sake of implementing.
Doing this project, I also found many new ideas wherein function calling can be used to solve new problems. I also learned many new things from enthusiastic peers like

@Jivraj
Is there something like peer-review in the project, I found this in the grading document.
Anyone having any idea on this?

A post was merged into an existing topic:
Project 1 - Casual banter

No human peer reviews. The peer will be an LLM that has been given the rubrics and fine tuned.
Kind regards

Would the scores of project 1 be released tomorrow?

@Yogesh1
We do not have an ETA on Project 1 scores yet. Might have more clarity soon.
Project 1 scores will be available roughly second week of March.
Kind regards

I know this is a late reply, but its not possible for us to consider changes to your project after the deadline for academic integrity purposes.
If we were to allow it, we would have to allow everyone to make changes to their project as well for it to be fair.
Kind regards

We will soon provide a complete solution for Project 1 because of its valuable learning.

Alright,
@Carlton
. No problem at all, and thank you for your response.
I just wanted to bring a small limitation in my project’s LLM function to your attention, which I discovered after submission. It may impact one or two tasks. However, no concerns—this has been a great learning experience.
And if possible, just add one line in your Evaluation LLM prompt:
“Give loose marking for effort!”
—because, you know, creativity deserves some extra credit!

I am not able to see my project marks please look into the problem

[2025-03-14T11:00:33.184Z] Carlton D'Silva (@carlton: Regular)
Its not been evaluated yet.
We are still processing them.
Kind regards

So will the solution be based on New MCP style or will they use the same function calling?

[2025-03-17T12:40:26.308Z] Carlton D'Silva (@carlton: Regular)
Definitely MCP style. Its the most elegant solution and it works beautifully. As soon as evals are done we will showcase it.

@carlton
Any ETA on project 1 scores?

[2025-03-23T07:02:28.304Z] Manmeet Kaur (@21f3001993)
I would like to request some bonus like 0.5 bonus mark for each day of delay from the original expected date of receiving score for Project 1 (will be life-saving for us and will be an incentive for team to release scores quickly; or request to TAs if you had better ideas for helping us score more in Project 1)!

[2025-03-26T08:05:58.369Z] Pradeep Mondal (@21f2000709)
Any Updates? Can we expect it to be out before P2 deadline?

This docker image has outlived many students’ hopes, dreams and ambitions of passing this course.
Why is it still not being detected properly on the docker hub?
What in the April Fools is this
It hasn’t even been morning yet!
PS (
@carlton
@Jivraj
): My P1 submission had passed all the basic sanity checks on 15th February. No breaking modifications to the Github repo nor the DockerHub image have been made since then. There’s something bugged in your scripts. Kindly check.

sir it seems like there was a problem when i pushed this files to the repo but i defenitely did correctly. PLease allow me to add docker file alone with your permission. As you can see i haven’t opened the dockerfile since the last date of project 1. Kindly allow this sir. and i have MiT license in my repo but still showing fail . kindly check that also sir.

I came pretty close, but too close(double entendre) to the deadline. Classic ICARUS stuff
