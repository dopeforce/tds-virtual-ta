Sir please shift the ROE date to another date because we really need time to understand all these stuffs as these are so hard for beginners like us and there is quiz 2 and we have to prepare for that also.
Sir please understand our situation and pay attention to our concern.

Also, it seems impossible to complete it in 45 minutes.

you got the wrong Anand here.  You perhaps wanted to tag the faculty of this course s.anand (Iâ€™m purposely not tagging him; you may do so)

I feel for you because you constantly get incorrectly tagged. On the plus side you are famous (or infamous depending on perspective
)
Kind regards

Just FYI the correct tag to use for Professor Anand of TDS is
@s.anand
Also ROE date will not be moved because its an exam date that has been set before the term starts. This is just part of the policy of the BS Programme. Exam dates never get moved except in truly exceptional circumstances.
Kind regards

Sir can you at least increase the time limit from 45 minutes to 1 hour?

[2025-02-26T10:24:40.604Z] Carlton D'Silva (@carlton: Regular)
The time limit for ROE will be set according to the difficulty level of the ROE.
Kind regards
