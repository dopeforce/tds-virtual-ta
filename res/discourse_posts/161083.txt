For question 16 of GA1, It says "Rename all files replacing each digit with the next "
Accepted answer is working only if file names are renamed as
2h3q9x.txt → 3h4q0x.txt
eb209nmlca.txt → eb310nmlca.txt
That means if digit is 9 then next digit should be 0.
@carlton
@Jivraj
let me know if this is what is expected. since 9->10 or 209 → 210 is not working

[2025-01-05T05:50:28.537Z] Jivraj Singh Shekhawat (@Jivraj: Course TA)
Hi anant,
Question mentions every digit should be replaced by next one.
In that case 209 would get replaced by 310

[2025-01-05T07:56:17.410Z] Anant Kumar Singh (@21f2000370)
Hello Sir, When I am following that logic to rename files, assessment check is giving error “Incorrect. Try again.”

Since you have managed to get all the answers correct, I presume there are no further issues w/ Q16.

As I highlighted earlier, Its not accepting the answer  if I follow correct logic for renaming for example 209->210, but it is accepting if rename as 209->310

Here in question, it’s mentioned to replace every digit with next digit, that’s why 209 would be 310.

In attempting the third question, I’m unable to download the npm package as it requires docker. When trying to install docker from the installer, it freezes in the verifying package stage. Can somebody please help solve my problem?

Hi Suhani,
npm does not require docker.
Kind regards

[2025-01-11T17:48:02.553Z] Carlton D'Silva (@carlton: Regular)
Hi Hisham,
Its described in the question. There is a hidden element hiding somewhere after that question. You would have to inspect the DOM to find it.

Hi manmeet,
I don’t know about solution to this.
Some network setting might be causing problem.
Alternatively you can make use of GitHub codespaces which provides 120 hours of free run time in a month. With GitHub codespaces you can use Ubuntu os, and visually it gives you feel of vs code. You can also active your GitHub student developer pack and get 180 hours of GitHub codespaces and some more benefits such as cloud resources and domains.
I have done all questions of week1 and week2 on codespaces only, codespaces works very well if you have good internet connection.

[2025-01-12T21:32:38.881Z] Jivraj Singh Shekhawat (@Jivraj: Course TA)
Hi samra,
Try installing some other browser see if that works.

Hi mishkat,
Without sharing code, can you pls share your approach how you are trying to solve this question.

[2025-01-13T00:51:15.378Z] Manmeet Kaur (@21f3001993)
Ok, thanks. I turned off many security features including anti-virus system’s security and windows security options etc. Then it allowed me to download uv on the system. Now it is running, and I got output as json for Q2.

2 days ago I  attempted TDS 2025 Jan GA1 - Development Tools and scored 8.5. I didn’t submit as I wanted to attempt incorrect answer questions.
When I logged in today it says score is 0.
Shall I submit or not? Do I have to attempt all questions again?
Why the assignment and submissions are two separate pages/links?
If [seek] (
Nptel Seekh
) can access [TDS exam] (
Technical Assessment
) then why we need to submit from seek?

[2025-01-13T07:21:41.338Z] Carlton D'Silva (@carlton: Regular)
The seek portal question is to confirm that the student has seen the GA. It does not actually give you a score. Otherwise students sometimes claim that they looked and did not find any GAs (this has happened in the past). Hence the two stage verification. You still need to
the submissions to get a score for the GA.
The actual GA questions are on
https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/
via the seek portal or
on the
Tools in Data Science
introduction page.
Its just a more robust way of ensuring that students have indeed viewed the GAs.
As far your submission goes, we have your last submission and the score.
We will check on our end why your submission has not reloaded into your browser.
Normally these are stored in session storage. So if your browser has deleted them, it might have not loaded from our back end server.
@s.anand
will be able to confirm the reason for this problem.
For the time being if you are making a fresh submission, just fill in all the answers in again, so that your latest submission will be marked correctly.
Kind regards

[2025-01-13T07:43:26.594Z] Nelson Jochim DSouza (@Nelson)
Thanks
@carlton
.
I answered questions on
https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/
but didn’t click on the button “Submit Answers” on seek as my answers for 2 questions were incorrect.
My question is whether I need to submit on seek to save answers on Exam? (I checked my score and saved it on the exam site.)

[2025-01-13T09:05:08.554Z] Carlton D'Silva (@carlton: Regular)
Hi
@Nelson
Your answers on the
exam
site that have been submitted will be saved and used as the basis for your score. Saying yes/no on seek does not materially impact scoring. Its just an awareness question. Even if you answered yes on the seek portal, you can still revise your answers on the exam site. The final submission is always whats locked in for the score (until the deadline passes).
Kind regards

[2025-01-13T09:26:22.507Z] Carlton D'Silva (@carlton: Regular)
It might be because you are not adding up the correct tags with attribute
data-value
. There may be other tags within the same DOM and having the attribute
data-value
.
Kind regards

[2025-01-13T12:52:10.903Z] Nelson Jochim DSouza (@Nelson)
I am stuck with the last question. SQLite question.
It gives the error:
Error: Got [[121510.39]]...
Is it possible to have a more descriptive error? It’s a simple SQL query. I tried various options in my query. I didn’t succeed.

Hi Shouvik,
Your code seems correct to me. I think there is an extra space before your answer in input box.
Btw instead of using a while loop, there is a much more optimal, which uses difference of dates and doesn’t require a loop at all. Try to figure it out.
kind regards

In all the video lectures, I am first required to download the tools, install them on my computer ? Is it not going to overload my computer’s RAM etc.,
In one of the classes, you said that there is something  - colab like cloud wherein we can go and practice without overloading our own computers. Will you please let me know how to go about it ??
Thanks and regards,
ULAGAOOZHIAN,

how to calculate How many Wednesdays are there in the date range 1981-08-30 to 2017-07-17?
The dates are in the year-month-day format. Include both the start and end date in your count. You can do this using any tool (e.g. Excel, Python, JavaScript, manually).

@Rohitkumar7463
@23f2003845
If you are on Windows Powershell
Then instead of
sha256sum
you can simply use
Get-FileHash
Send the output of the
npx -y prettier@3.4.2 README.md
to a text file eg.
output.txt
and then use
Get-FileHash
on powershell with the
output.txt
and it will use sha256 by default and give you the exact same output.
You might be able to pipe the data directly to
Get-FileHash
but I have not tried direct piping. The above method works guaranteed.

Sir
as you said in the previous post, the evaluation script is also updated based on errors other students point out.
I am submitting my answers as soon as the GA is released and stopping once I get 10/10.
Will you reevaluate the answers once the deadline is over? Or the marks I see right now will be set in stone?
If you will, then it will be based on the updated evaluation script which can reduce my marks.

But since you

The hash code is exactly what you see under the column Hash,
7E…E5
Thats the Hash code for the file output.txt
A Hash is a
nearly
unique representation of some data within some range dependent on the type of hashing algorithm and the amount of unique pieces of data that need to be encoded. (just my colloquial definition of it, i am sure you are able to ask GPT to give you a much better explanation)

Time Zone Issues with the “List Files and Attributes” Question
quick heads‐up about Question 15 (the one asking for files at least 8143 bytes, modified on or after Sun, 19 Nov 2006, 7:38 am GMT‑5). I’m physically in a different time zone, but I eventually discovered the question seems to expect you to be located in India and to interpret that files date/time accordingly.
I got the correct answer once i localized the files timestamp to IST.

Hi Saravanan,
I noticed an issue with your submission. In the question, there is a name
Bob
, but it doesn’t appear in your answer after applying the required sorting. Since the data for each student is dynamically generated and unique, the answer you submitted seems inconsistent with your dataset.
We encourage collaboration among students, but copying answers is not acceptable. Instead, I suggest reaching out to your friend to understand the script they used, run it on your dataset, and ensure you fully grasp the solution.

Your format seems to be correct, but cause you are still facing that problem then these are the few reasons I can think of
Check the entire JSON object and make sure that each and every element follows this format.
Use Chrome for getting that hash code, it could be the case that some other browser may not be pasting the object as intended.
