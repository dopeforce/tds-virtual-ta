If someone Scrapes the GA Questions with Answers , Can you Please Send them , All of us have might have different GAs (a lil bit maybe), so more data more helpful. PLEASE HELP‚Ä¶
Project 2 - TDS Solver - Shared Data Pool
Tools in Data Science
Project 2 - TDS Solver - Discussion Thread
Creating this Thread to share answers and questions from your respective assignments
Why?
If we can Train the LLM with these Questions already, we can easily do well?
Too many Questions for LLM
True we can use embeddings, map that stored in-system dictionary and use relevant questions from in-system data to send as context with answer
What We need from YOU ü´µüèΩ
Get to scraping your respective Gra‚Ä¶

is it possible to have written solutions to all 5 assignments , instead of just live sessions. I have certain pending questions from the first 5 assignements.

[2025-03-03T05:12:53.749Z] Hardik D (@22f3002291)
Please quickly arrange a live TDS session to explain this project. There are a lot of doubts and questions in our minds.

[2025-03-03T05:33:25.883Z] Hardik D (@22f3002291)
Please also give access to the answers for GAs. So that we can evaluate our api with the correct answers.

[2025-03-03T06:20:33.077Z] Praphull Kumar Shahi  (@23f3001743)
If we use ngrok to create a tunnel to our API or Llamafile server, for how long should our terminal remain running? Should it be active only at the time of submission, or must it be continuously available until evaluation is completed?

[2025-03-03T06:40:11.842Z] B R GIRI SUBRAHMANYA (@23f2000573)
Is it like only the questions from the portal will be sent to the api?
If yes, is this project just about finding which question is asked and accordingly match the answer send the answer as response?

Hello Sir,
I understand that we can deploy on vercel. Can it be deployed on Heroku as well? I believe both serve the same purpose. Wanted to know your thoughts on the same sir.
Thanks and Regards
Shalini

[2025-03-03T07:33:25.182Z] Jivraj Singh Shekhawat (@Jivraj: Course TA)
If you use ngrok, ensure that it is running continuously until you get your results

[2025-03-03T07:34:57.718Z] Jivraj Singh Shekhawat (@Jivraj: Course TA)
Any question from first 5 Ga‚Äôs can be there and you would need to analyze which question it is, you can use function calling or prompting as well. Function calling is better approach here.

[2025-03-03T07:38:24.972Z] Jivraj Singh Shekhawat (@Jivraj: Course TA)
Hi
@24f2006531
You can deploy it anywhere, just test how it works on Heroku, if it works(send request to api endpoint to your application and it should respond with answer)
Kind regards

will the asked question be same which was asked in my GAs (i mean there were variations in problem statements for diff-diff students.)
@Jivraj
sir

[2025-03-03T08:59:32.067Z] Yogesh (@Yogesh1)
Was the variation because of the datasets? Or even the problem statement?

[2025-03-03T09:25:06.689Z] Guddu Kumar Mishra  (@22f3001315)
Mostly problem statement like different cities etc

[2025-03-03T09:29:47.534Z] Yogesh (@Yogesh1)
Then it comes down to what the project demands, as in what kind of questions the llm will be tested on (like you said). Hope the team can give us a test set like in the first project.

[2025-03-03T09:42:02.201Z] Nilay Chugh (@nilaychugh)
my question is some graded assignments have image files as a answer, so should our api return files as the answer or like can you clarify what type of answers we need to work on?

[2025-03-03T10:04:24.668Z] Sakthivel S (@23f2000237)
I guess yes, our APIs should return photos if required

[2025-03-03T16:35:20.859Z] Vivek Rekha Ashoka (@23f3001745)
There are a total of 57 questions in all 5 GAs(18+10+9+10+10).
Due to so many different formats of accepting questions and solving them, my main question is:
Is the main essence of this project related to deciphering cryptic js code in order to scrape it?
Some other doubts are
Some questions ask for you to access some hidden divs in the html page and use that for solving (like week 1 q11)
Some questions ask you for AIPROXY TOKENs (like week 3 q9)
Some questions required manual correction to get correct answers (like week 4 q2)
Some questions require file output (like week 2 q2)
How do we account for this?

[2025-03-03T16:49:05.470Z] Vinil (@23f2004837)
I have few questions just going through the Project 2 problem statement.
Are we supposed to use OpenAI api‚Äôs or locally/private hosted one?
Many of the questions need files or images or audio files as input, same api is expected to handle those also?
Can we work in a team and submit the project together?
If we are to use locally hosted llm system, our systems are not strong enough to run most of the good ones locally
Is it possible to get a TA to collaborate in our project as an observer?
awaiting a response.
Thank you‚Ä¶

@Saransh_Saini
Dear Sir,
I have few questions. It is written in the
Tools in Data Science
that we can expose the api using vercel (the example given also uses vercel). But I don‚Äôt think vercel can handle/allow many operations, some of them are listed below.
In GA 1 ques 13 and  GA 2 Ques 7, we have to create github repo, then creating github actions and then retrieve the raw github file url. We can accomplish this using Github CLI
gh
which we have to install in the vercel instance using
apt
package manager.
But, Vercel does not provide sudo access which is required to install packages.
In GA 2 ques 10, we have to use local LLM (Llamafile), will vercel allow that?
Also after that, we have to give answer as the ngrok public url for which we have to first install
ngrok
package.
In GA 2 ques 8,  uploading an image to Dockerhub requires
docker
package installed.
In GA 2 ques 6, Deploy a Python API to Vercel in a Vercel instance?
Many ques require writing and running FastAPI server to serve data with CORS enabled. Can Vercel allow/do that?
And many more
Most tasks mentioned above like installing packages etc. requires sudo privilages or may face restrictions set by Vercel.
Vercel does not provide sudo access or any form of root access to its hosting environment which is required to perform the above tasks.
Many of these task can be done in our local systems (exposing to internet using cloudflare tunnels/ngrok), but we cannot run our systems 24*7 during evaluation.
I can see only one option left that is renting a VPS from server providers like digitalocean, gcp, aws etc, which will provide us sudo access and 100% uptime.
Also, some ques requires external toolings like
In GA1 ques 5, it is written to explicitly use Excel and this will only work in Office 365.
In GA1 ques 6, we have to use Devtools to show/find the hidden element in the question. Now, the question parameter in the POST request will be plain text, so how the element can hide there?
GA 2 ques 4 and GA 2 ques 5 uses Google Colab specific python libraries like google.colab which can‚Äôt be installed locally.
How to solve these above questions that require explicit usage of external tools.
Also, handling POST request for some questions are not clear like
In GA 2 ques 2, we have to compress the image and upload the image as answer. So, now how to response such answer in json object. Should we encode the resultant compressed image as base64 string or Image URL or  Data URI.
Some ques have images in them. For those images in GAs, I right clicked and used ‚ÄúSave as‚Äù to save the images and then done the required computations. So, now when this question will be sent as POST request, will the image be included as the base64 encoded string in the question parameter of the POST request itself or as an optional file attachment?
Another concern is regarding the OpenAI API TOKEN, unlike Project 1, Project 2 does not have an API_TOKEN parameter in the POST request. Hence, the API TOKEN provided from
https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev
will be also used during evaluation. Now, what will happen if our API TOKEN credits gets end during evaluation. The LLM will throw errors then.
Please advise what we should do. please clarify Sir.

[2025-03-06T07:24:07.488Z] Kabir Vyas (@Kabir1203)
Can you provide with an evaluation file like we had for Project 1.

If you are talking about the parameters of those questions, then it would be better if you make your API capable of working with different parameters.

[2025-03-06T09:32:07.810Z] Saransh Saini (@Saransh_Saini: Course TA)
Well if your API is capable of solving those questions in your GAs with the expected answer, then that‚Äôs sufficient validation.

[2025-03-06T09:38:01.726Z] Saransh Saini (@Saransh_Saini: Course TA)
If you are indicating towards working collaboratively then,
Yes, we encourage you to collaborate with others and collectively work towards solving this project. Even if you are going for the relatively easiest approach of Function Calling, it would require you to code about 50 functions to solve all your tasks. Which is why it is sensible to work collectively.

[2025-03-06T11:22:47.655Z] Shalini Saravanan (@24f2006531)
Hello Sir,
I have a few questions. Would like your thoughts and suggestions over the same.
Currently answers that we have entered for GA‚Äôs 1 to 4 are not available and only for GA5 its available. It would be helpful for the project (when running the Curl command for each of the question) if the assignments can display the answers we‚Äôve entered as well for verification purposes.
The first question of GA1 q1 needs for us to run vs code but when executing it through vercel its not possible because vercel is a serverless environment. In this case, is it okay to manually enter the answer in the code, so when the question is triggered it takes the manual output from the code.
Can you provide some clarity as to how the question is supposed to be and structured ? Or should the code be able to handle multiple variants of the question? To address this concern, i tried to implement sentence_transformers using a lightweight model but the vercel application build failed saying that the data is too long and that Vercel serverless function deployment size exceeds the limit of 250 MB. Should i consider deploying elsewhere or change the approach?
How do we handle questions pertaining to Devtools - creating input box etc.
Thanks and Regards
Shalini

[2025-03-07T04:49:57.688Z] Andrew David (@23f1002382)
What does it mean to solve the question?
Everyone is asking that?
Do you yourself know what to do and to go about it?
Or just pull out something from your hAtSS at the last moment?
‚Äúand responds with the answer to enter in the assignment.‚Äù
From my understanding only those questions that are solved with a program and give an answer are to be considered‚Ä¶ For example it states in the project that
" The response must be a JSON object with a single text (string) field:
answer
that can be directly entered in the assignment. For example:"
If you all still have not responded, then I‚Äôm honestly not sure if this is what y‚Äôall meant.
Last project was not clear to some extent, This time its even more vague.
I understand that y‚Äôall want to give different projects to help High Order Thinking skills, but if not executed properly, no one actually learns anything and we(I) just end by debugging the project statement code and question with no relevance to the project. If we wanted to do that, I could just go random GitHub repos and solve and create pull requests for a specific bug. Also we end up losing interest thinking most if the course instructors don‚Äôt what they are doing. I understand Anand Sir is extremely busy(like really busy lol), but what are the course instructors doing?

I just want to know if you prefer using an existing language model application where we utilize an LLM (Large Language Model), train it, and format the output. For instance, I used the Gemini API key, integrated it with Python, and then formatted the results with the help of Copilot to achieve the desired outputs.
Alternatively, do you want us to create a new LLM model and train it with questions from graded assignments? I‚Äôm curious about your preference.
Additionally, would you like the LLM to provide specific answers regarding computer specifications, or should it give general specifications? For example, in Graded Assignment 1, there is a question about the editor: Visual Studio Code.
Your editor is the most important tool in your arsenal; that‚Äôs where you‚Äôll spend most of your time, so make sure you‚Äôre comfortable with it.
Visual Studio Code is, by far, the most popular code editor today. According to the 2024 Stack Overflow Survey, almost 75% of developers use it. We recommend you learn it well. Even if you use another editor, you‚Äôll likely work with others who use VS Code, so having some exposure is beneficial.
To get started, you can watch these introductory videos (totaling 35 minutes) from the Visual Studio Docs:
Getting Started: Set up and learn the basics of Visual Studio Code (7 min)
Code Editing: Learn how to edit and run code in VS Code (3 min)
Productivity Tips: Become a VS Code power user with these productivity tips (4 min)
Personalize: Personalize VS Code to make it yours with themes (2 min)
Extensions: Add features, themes, and more to VS Code with extensions (4 min)
Debugging: Get started with debugging in VS Code (6 min)
Version Control: Learn how to use Git version control in VS Code (3 min)
Customize: Learn how to customize your settings and keyboard shortcuts in VS Code (6 min)
AI Editors: Copilot, Cursor
Note: AI editors like Cursor, Cody, and GitHub Copilot use LLMs to help you write code faster. These tools are built on top of VS Code and have become standard in every developer‚Äôs toolkit. Please make sure to use them.
To install and run Visual Studio Code, open your Terminal (or Command Prompt) and type
code -s
, then press Enter. Copy and paste the entire output below.
What is the output of
code -s
? The output of
code -s
cannot be universally answered because it depends on the user‚Äôs system and the specific version of VS Code installed. The question requests the output of a command that is unique to each user.
As for the part about getting answers from the LLM model, I believe that may require using an AI agent. I am currently searching for a solution for this, and I would like to know your thoughts on it.

My Approach , is to
scrape and parse all the current question
create embeddings ,  of the questions.
create a test endpoint , just to check if i am able to correctly identify the questions
segregate numerical , string and json responses and see if these can be answered part of phase 1
Phase 2 , experiment with url based answers. need to see if an MCP server can come in handy
to deploy a server and return an url

[2025-03-17T05:21:00.055Z] Ayush Kumar Shaw  (@23f2001286)
Since the token is limited, I have thought to use the run llms locally,  to check for the accuracy of solving the question.
I want to know which LLM will be more closer to the one used for evaluating our project.
Does the model used for evaluation is capable for handling raw files, or we need to pass it in the text format..(As as I am to recall, the models are capable enough to handle the files..)
Thanks!
Does anyone willing to work with me..?

Should we answer the questions and return the response to enter in the answer box(as stated in the question) or should we just provide instructions on how to go about solving the question? Some of the questions include pictures and we cannot use LLM for pictures.

[2025-03-18T05:56:47.593Z] Carlton D'Silva (@carlton: Regular)
The key learning objective for Project 2 is for you to be absolutely comfortable interacting with APIs and understanding how they work to perform tasks.
So there is very little need for the use of LLMs or agents.
Identify the the question being asked (how you do this is upto you, you can be as simplistic as using regex to look for some key words, or you can be clever and create embeddings out of the original question and calculate the similarity from the request)
Create a function that solves the question with the required parameters and inputs. Remember this does not have to be fancy. Just compute the answer. You do not need to do the task as the GA required. You ONLY want the answer. No tools required. Just a computed answer.
Give the answer back as specified.
Kind regards

You do not need to do the task as the GA required.
Does this mean this type of question won‚Äôt be paramaterized?
Like instead of
code -s
there won‚Äôt be any other command, otherwise it would require installation of VS Code inside a container to find the answer or this type of questions won‚Äôt be part of evaluation at all?
The same confusion is for these type of questions as well:

there will not be any other command. This question can be solved with a hardcoded answer
Excel and Google sheet questions can be solved by just using python . No excel or google sheets required.
The question WILL be parameterised however. So the numbers might be different. You should just understand what the question is asking and solve it programatically to get the answer.

[2025-03-18T14:57:56.661Z] Ansh bansal (@23f2004752)
And the answer will be in string format ??

[2025-03-18T15:22:05.912Z] Carlton D'Silva (@carlton: Regular)
I am not sure how you came to that conclusion!
For example vercel question still requires a vercel endpoint that will respond.
What I said is some questions might not need you to use those specific tools. Your answers should still be legitimate answers that one can paste into the text box of a GA and still get it correct.
The only question that will not be asked is the LLM say yes question.
A github account would still need you to commit a file to it and provide the url that is reachable.
etc.

Hi TAs,
I attended the meet which happened today. But I don‚Äôt clearly get one thing.
Most of the questions have a
question text
and a
file: csv,zip,json,etc
My doubt is, will the request to the end point be :
curl -X POST "https://your-app.vercel.app/api/" \
  -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
  -F "question=question text" \
  -F "file=https://stats.espncricinfo.com/stats/engine/stats/index.html?class=2;template=results;type=batting"
my doubt :
Is this the only format or can there be other too ?

[2025-03-19T23:16:56.670Z] Jivraj Singh Shekhawat (@Jivraj: Course TA)
Hi
@23f2000573
Yes this is correct format for the question, It will have 2 fields question and file.
You can send a file from local machine like this
-F "file=@abcd.zip"
so here
abcd.zip
must be in current working directory.
Kind regards

[2025-03-20T05:37:01.038Z] B R GIRI SUBRAHMANYA (@23f2000573)
Fine sir, this is clear. I have a few doubts in the file formats. When free, kindly address these to. I will try to cover most common doubts, so that you wouldn‚Äôt need to answer similar doubts again. Sorry if some of the doubts are basic / written incorrectly.
FILES
The data file sent to the api will always be in the
requester‚Äôs
local machine. When the api server receives the request, the file will be in binary format?
Or
Sometimes the api server receives the file in byte and some times, it will recieve a link like this :
https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/shapes.png
This link was take from GA2 Question 2
HTML AND TABLE
Some questions have
html
and
tables
. In this case will these two be in a file encoded in binary, or will it be a string.
Example for string. Consider the table
Col 1
Col 2
Row 1, Col1
Row 1 Col 2
Row 2, Col 1
Row 2 Col 2
Will this be something like this
"|Col 1| Col 2|\n|-|-|\n|Row 1, Col1 | Row 1 Col 2|\n|Row 2, Col 1|Row 2 Col 2|"
or something like
"<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Col 1</th>\n<th>Col 2</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Row 1, Col1</td>\n<td>Row 1 Col 2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Row 2, Col 1</td>\n<td>Row 2 Col 2</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>
"
HIDDEN BLOCK AND ANSWER : 2 TASKS
In one question, there were two tasks.
Find the answer to the question
Enable the
disabled
text block
In this question, what will the answer type be?
Should it just be the answer or should it be the html string which will have the disabled block enabled and also the answer string sitting inside the block
MORE THAN ONE FILE
Some questions have more than one file. For example, the last question of GA5, it has a png file in this link
https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/jigsaw.webp
and a table.
In this case, how will the curl request be? Is it some thing like this
curl -X POST "https://your-app.vercel.app/api/" \
  -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
  -F "question=question text" \
  -F "file= Image file" \
  -F "file= table file/ string"
CORS HEADERS
Will the CORS headers asked in the question be the same or can it be different?

[2025-03-20T09:51:16.458Z] Durga Prasad (@22f3001307)
Hi,
In GA 2, q5, this is the code i got in the question.
import numpy as np
from PIL import Image
from google.colab import files
import colorsys

# There is a mistake in the line below. Fix it
image = Image.open(list(files.upload().keys)[0])

rgb = np.array(image) / 255.0
lightness = np.apply_along_axis(lambda x: colorsys.rgb_to_hls(*x)[1], 2, rgb)
light_pixels = np.sum(lightness > 0.554)
print(f'Number of pixels with lightness > 0.554: {light_pixels}')
Is this the code for others as well?
Thanks

So I was thinking to create the project 2 together and I was looking for collaboration, and for that we would require the following:
‚Üí the set of question-answers pairs at first
‚Üí All the questions of 2 distinct students to see which parameters changes in each questions
‚Üí Make the solution functional and parameterised based on previous step.
Till now I have created the following:
‚Üí Identification of the question, using embeddings
‚Üí extraction of parameters using llm for that particular question
‚Üí Implementation of 3 questions using this approach
If we come together, we all can reduce the workload and complete it on time.
*Those who resonate with my approach or have any different approach feel free to leave a DM. I might not respond immediately as I might not be online all the time

"<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Col 1</th>\n<th>Col 2</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Row 1, Col1</td>\n<td>Row 1 Col 2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Row 2, Col 1</td>\n<td>Row 2 Col 2</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>
This is correct html table format.
23f2000573:
Should it just be the answer or should it be the html string which will have the disabled block enabled and also the answer string sitting inside the block
It will be just answer.

In last question of GA5 there is only one file(image), table is not coming through file, it will be kept same for project2.
23f2000573:
Will the CORS headers asked in the question be the same or can it be different?
I didn‚Äôt get this question, could you point to exact question?

Sir, a few things are not yet clear .
Jivraj:
file format will be exactly same as corresponding GA.
Some questions have
clickable html buttons
. When we click that, the zipfile or json file, or csv gets downloaded
Some questions have
image attached to the text
. For this, we have to use
right click ‚Üí download the image
. Here, the image is take from some url. For example. in GA2, q2, the image displayed is taken from
https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/shapes.png
.
My doubt is, what will be the value of file attribute in curl command
Will it be
‚Äúfile=binary of zipfile/csv/json‚Äù for the first type and
‚Äúfile=
https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/shapes.png
‚Äù for the second type
Jivraj:
This is correct html table format.
Will this table be in the ‚Äúquestion‚Äù attribute of curl or ‚Äúfile‚Äù attribute
Jivraj:
In last question of GA5 there is only one file(image), table is not coming through file, it will be kept same for project2.
so, can I assume that the table will be given as a html element in the ‚Äúquestion‚Äù attribute and the image in the ‚Äúfile‚Äù attribute?

‚Äúfile=

Files will be exactly same as GA assignment, if there is url then it will be a url and if it get‚Äôs downloaded by clicking then it will come from requester‚Äôs machine.
23f2000573:
so, can I assume that the table will be given as a html element in the ‚Äúquestion‚Äù attribute and the image in the ‚Äúfile‚Äù attribute?
For questions that have table they will either come as html code or as markdown. Keep a if else condition for identifying which case it is, if it‚Äôs a html then beautiful soup should be able to find table tag, if it‚Äôs markdown table then it can be identified with
|
characters.

The portal accept answers in strict json with double quotes. Now in the project we need to return the answer in string value which again has double quotes, so the best answer I could get is using
\"
inside the answer like this.
But still the GA portal marks it as invalid json. What to do in this case?

This works, just send a string which can be loaded as json object.

[2025-03-21T11:59:22.000Z] Carlton D'Silva (@carlton: Regular)
The correct answer has to be with the escape sequence otherwise you cannot send a valid response back.
We never feed your response to the GA by copy pasting.

So the questions expecting JSON will be jsonified separately before passing to the evaluator because in the current implementation in the text field idk why it is failing to load the json with
\"
however I could load the exact thing using json.loads in python.

For questions like this (there‚Äôs a similar one in GA1 too, will the user send the USER and REPO of their GitHub account as parameters too?
Even if they do, my script may not get necessary authentication to create repo and make commit in their repository. In this case, would I have to implement GitHub OAuth flow?
If they don‚Äôt send those details but just the email and I am expected to just change the email in my own repo and commit, in the worst case making the same change repeatedly may be misconstrued as a DDoS attack by an automated script which may lead to my GitHub account being suspended, which does not seem ideal.
Can you please at least hint at a solution?
Edit: Same query for the GitHub actions question (GA2 Q7)
Another edit: A similar query for GA2 Q8. Repeated dockerimage pushes to Dockerhub with different tags.

[2025-03-22T07:20:54.446Z] Shivaditya Bhattacharya (@22f3000819)
Use the following script to enable answer boxes and check answers buttons:
inputs = document.querySelectorAll('input')
textboxes = document.querySelectorAll("textarea")
buttons  = document.querySelectorAll("button")
inputs.forEach(input => input.removeAttribute('disabled'));
buttons.forEach(input => input.removeAttribute('disabled'));
textboxes.forEach(input => input.removeAttribute('disabled'));

Just that it should have github pages with that particular email address.

In evaluation we will only send request one worst case twice or thrice if it fails from our end, so no issues with that.

Hello.. I am facing issue with zip file extraction function which is in many GA1 questions. e.g., for GA1 Q15, if I use 7-zip to extract files, it shows the correct total size when using Postman for local server. If I use python built-in function, it calculates a different value (which is incorrect). So, I used 7-zip. But I (with help from copilot agent) am not able to make 7-zip work on the vercel deployment. Can we just hard code the answers to GA1 questions, or is there a way to take answer from local server and use it for response in vercel (sorry, it doesn‚Äôt even make sense to me, but a lot of things are hard to understand anyway)? Or how do we resolve this 7-zip issue. Python built-in extraction did not work correctly even after hours of trying..
I have another question. Due to lack of time, if I just submit the Project 2, with question/answers to GA1, (and if these all work as expected on vercel), how much approx score can we get if I am not able to do other GAs at all for Project 2. Edit after posting: I can hard code questions and other answers from GA2 upto GA4 (I missed GA5, so don‚Äôt have those answers). Thank you.

[2025-03-23T06:48:43.066Z] Pradeep Mondal (@21f2000709)
I too want to know like by 5 questions at random, is it 1 random question per GA or 5 random questions from the entire 5 GAs?
In the later case, there would be no certainty unless all of our questions works and there aren‚Äôt any unexpected surprises at the evaluation.

[2025-03-23T10:56:47.658Z] Veer Shah (@23f1001524)

I faced the same issue. Initially, I used
geopy.geocoders
to solve the question, and it provided the correct answer during the assignment submission. However, the same approach is now giving an incorrect result.
Instead of using
geopy
, try using this URL directly:
https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/search
.
This worked for me.

I have a doubt like when I pass answers in string and in the questions about markdown will the \n characters be properly parsed before checking the correctness of the markdown or will it be directly checked for valid markdown? Because the raw string when pasted in the text box of the GA isn‚Äôt getting the markdown.
In case of image compression question, should I return the base64 encoding of the compressed image?

Respected TDS Team,
I currently have Three doubts regarding
Project 2
:
As per the 19th March session, it was mentioned that the files would be the same for everyone, and only the parameters in the questions would vary. However, I have noticed that the files can actually be different. To support this, I‚Äôm attaching screenshots of the CSV files for GA5 Q1‚Äîone is mine, and the other belongs to a batchmate.
mydata
939√ó401 18.3 KB
friend data
938√ó465 20.5 KB
During the session, it was said that uploading files would take time, and the suggested solution was to pre-download the files on the server since they are supposed to be the same. But since the files are not identical for all students, this issue needs to be addressed.
In
GA4 Q2
, my task is to retrieve movie information from IMDb for all films with a rating between 3 and 5. I am scraping the correct movie names(for example 6th movie in given image), but the portal is accepting them differently. All movie names are provided in English, but the portal seems to be accepting some titles in other languages‚ÄîSpanish, Dutch, I believe.

Short Answer: No

Backslashes are usually not a problem when converting a string to JSON. But somehow the evaluation script isn‚Äôt taking this into consideration. Check this out.

During the session, it was said that uploading files would take time, and the suggested solution was to pre-download the files on the server since they are supposed to be the same. But since the files are not identical for all students, this issue needs to be addressed.
The file is just 341kb. it should take less than a second. So you do not have to pre download this file. Only very large ones that are not parameterised you can have a hard copy of.

Questions Requiring Clarification/Manual Intervention for Evaluation (As Discussed in Tuesday‚Äôs Session)
Respected TDS Team,
As per the discussion during the Tuesday session, and following
@Saransh
‚Äôs suggestion, I am creating this post to list the questions that may require manual intervention or are facing issues potentially due to portal-side behavior. Kindly verify these points before evaluation.
Questions Requiring Manual Intervention / Portal-Side Issue
GA3 Q8
Issue: The question doesn‚Äôt mention all required queries. Although all mentioned queries were added, the portal seems to check for additional queries not stated, resulting in an incorrect answer flag.
GA3 Q9
Issue: This question asks to create an LLM prompt, but upon submission, a pop-up requests the AIPROXY_TOKEN.
Clarification needed: How are we supposed to handle token-based inputs for evaluation?
GA4 Q2 & Q10
Issue: Previously encountered issues have been resolved.
Reference:
GA4 Q2 and Q10 resolution
Output Formatting (Multiple Questions)
Issue: When using plain text, the answer is accepted. However, in JSON format, newline characters (\n) and backslashes are added.
Note: As per the project requirement, the output should be in JSON like {‚Äúanswer‚Äù: ‚Äúresult‚Äù}. But directly copy-pasting such a result with special characters leads to rejection by the portal.
Vercel / Docker Hub / Ngrok Deployment Questions
Issue: Some deployment-related questions require a **live-running server, which needs real-time manual deployment using platforms like Vercel or Ngrok.
Clarification needed: How is this expected to be evaluated?
Deployment-Related Issues (To Be Included in Thursday‚Äôs Session)
Please include discussion and solutions for the following deployment issues:
Platform Capability for GA Tasks
Which cloud platform (Azure, DigitalOcean, etc.) can handle all GA tasks reliably?
Note: Some platforms have limitations that block certain tasks or token usage.
File Upload Example via Platform API
Request: Please provide examples for both small and large file uploads using API from a cloud-deployed app.
This would help validate deployments for assignment questions involving file input.
General Observations on GA1-5
Output Accuracy: Approximately 80% of the questions in GA1-5 return correct output when tested on a local machine. However, about 20% either have portal-side issues or deployment-related problems.
Kindly review these points before final evaluation, and let us know if any additional clarification is required from our side.

, is it possible to extend the deadline by 2 days April 1st, since we can use the LLM api a little more and Most people(me atleast) have Their OPPEs and its combined syllabus (and the OPPE 1 did not go well, partly due to my inadequacies) , which has much more to cover, since this project involves more involved coding compared to the last project(ideally project one should have taken not more than a day , still messed it up though xD). Asking for extension for 2 days, if possible. Really need it not even want, like

Hi
@23f1002382
,
Unfortunately it‚Äôs not possible for us to extend the deadline. Project 2 was released almost a month back, and that can be considered ample amount of time to complete the project. I can understand it must be hard to deal with it along with an upcoming OPPE, but this is what it is. Even if you are not able to cover all the 58 questions, try to cover the majority of them, as the evaluation involves sending just 1-3 questions for evals.
All the best for your OPPE and your Project 2

@23f2003751
Yes you are absolutely right. I confirmed this with Carlton and Anand sir, and yes you have to send the JSON responses as strings, which will automatically add those backslashes(\). I apologies for causing this confusion, and I hope I was able to clarify it.

[2025-03-26T11:49:47.787Z] Saransh Saini (@Saransh_Saini: Course TA)

Yes, it will. Just make sure that doing a json.loads() on this string should give you the desired output.

[2025-03-27T06:45:58.204Z] Shivaditya Bhattacharya (@22f3000819)
The GA portal marks it as wrong unless I manually insert new lines. I hope that won‚Äôt be an issue, will it?

[2025-03-27T07:05:51.741Z] Carlton D'Silva (@carlton: Regular)
Your markdown must have newline characters or spaces wherever necessary. Otherwise we will not be able to check if your answer is correct. Our parser will only work if encodings for the formatting are present in the response. If there are no encodings (invisible or visible) then we will not have the correctly formatted file.
Please review module 1 for a better understanding about how text is encoded. Especially invisible characters.
The browser is designed for user friendliness. Thats why the characters are invisible when you copy paste string with newlines. But it exists.
The programmatic strings show invisible encodings as escaped characters. (Usually)
To check if a string has invisible characters,
# Multi-line string
my_string = """Hello
World    with    spaces
and some newlines
and a tab	"""

# Print ASCII values of each character
print([ord(c) for c in my_string])
e.g., newline = 10, tab = 9
This is a great way to check what we are receiving when you send us some response,
import requests
import json

# This is just an example server to see what we see.

url = "https://httpbin.org/post"

my_multiline_string_answer = """This is a multiline
string that spans
multiple lines    with    spaces
and some newlines
and a tab	as well."""

response_to_send_to_tds_evaluator = {
"answer": my_multiline_string_answer
}

# Send the JSON data
response = requests.post (url, json=response_to_send_to_tds_evaluator)

# Check the response
print (response.status_code)
print (response.json ())
print (response.text)

# Do other checks as necessary...
See what happens when I print the result
print (json.loads (response.text)['json']['answer'])
Screenshot 2025-03-27 at 1.09.56 pm
323√ó120 3.61 KB
Its a proper multiline correctly formatted text! The encodings are invisible just like in the original as well as in your clipboard when you copy paste into the GA.
Here is a json example:
json_answer = {
    "mary": "poppins",
    "age": 42
}

stringed_json = json.dumps (json_answer)
response_to_send_to_tds_evaluator = {
"answer": stringed_json
}

response = requests.post (url, json=response_to_send_to_tds_evaluator)

print (json.loads (response.text)['json']['answer'])
Look at the response. A perfect json.
If you do not want spaces in the response then strip the spaces before you send the stringified response.
Kind regards

I would request the TDS team to please consider making the evaluation criteria for project 2 a bit more liberal.
5 random Questions with 4 marks each is quite harsh. I request you to make it more balanced like 2 Qs from each GA with 2 marks each or so. So that even if we can‚Äôt exhaustively cover the whole number of questions, it gives mercy for the partial completion.
5 random question is a kind of lottery or luck based unless our app is perfect. Thanks

GA2 - Question 3: Publish a Page Using GitHub Pages
As part of the requirement, I successfully published a webpage using GitHub Pages that includes my email address
21f3001076@ds.study.iitm.ac.in
in the HTML content. The page functions correctly and becomes accessible on my local system.
To automate the publishing process, I implemented a delay function that checks for the page‚Äôs availability after 5 seconds. Based on testing, GitHub Pages typically take around 10‚Äì20 seconds to go live after repository creation and HTML deployment. As a result, the complete process‚Äîfrom initiating the API call to verifying that the page is live‚Äîtakes approximately 30 seconds locally. This setup works reliably on my local machine.
However, when deploying the same process on Azure, I encountered an issue. Without the delay, the API responds too quickly‚Äîbefore the GitHub Pages site is actually live‚Äîresulting in a broken or non-functional link on the assignment portal. On the other hand, including the delay function causes Azure to throw a
502 Bad Gateway
error, likely due to Azure‚Äôs request timeout limitations. The additional wait time slightly exceeds the platform‚Äôs allowed response duration.
GA4 - Question 9: Process PDF Files
A similar issue occurs in GA4 Question 9, where the task involves processing PDF files. While this works perfectly in the local environment, it leads to a
502 Bad Gateway
error on Azure. This is due to the relatively long time required to parse and analyze the PDFs, which again exceeds Azure‚Äôs execution time limit.
Moreover, pre-processing the PDF files is not an option because the input varies for each user. Therefore, the PDFs must be processed dynamically, which adds to the delay and contributes to the timeout problem.
Currently, I am using Azure for deployment, and for the majority of tasks, it works reliably. Although these specific tasks face timeout issues, shifting to another deployment platform is not feasible at this point. I am not certain if alternative platforms will work consistently across all questions, and making such a change could introduce failures in other parts of the assignment where Azure performs well.
Below Image is showing response of local machine api request for GA2 Q3 which works fine.

Final Thoughts on Project 2
Project 2 has been a valuable yet challenging experience. I‚Äôd like to share a few reflections‚Äînot as criticism, but as constructive feedback with the intention to contribute positively to future iterations.
Organization & Structure:
The project felt a bit unstructured at times, which may be expected given that this is possibly the first time such an initiative is being carried out. I‚Äôm not blaming anyone‚Äîjust sharing my thoughts. I hope positive insights can be drawn from this feedback.
Deployment & Portal Limitations:
There are noticeable limitations on the deployment side (e.g., timeouts, platform constraints) and occasional issues on the assignment portal. While frustrating, these also led to some deep technical learning.
Time Constraints:
Balancing this project with ongoing coursework and other responsibilities has been quite demanding. The deadline of March 31st adds pressure, making it difficult to thoroughly test all 57 questions across different environments.
Sessions & Support:
The sessions conducted were helpful in addressing specific topics, but in many areas, I had to rely heavily on GPT and self-guided exploration to move forward.
Deployment Variability:
Each GA‚Äôs questions seemed to expose different limitations depending on the deployment platform. This inconsistency made it hard to predict which questions would work reliably.
Effort Acknowledgment:
I sincerely appreciate the efforts of the TAs and instructors‚Äîit‚Äôs clear that a lot of hard work went into enabling and supporting this project. However, it‚Äôs also a bit disappointing that we, as students, are unsure which questions are expected to work and which may fail‚Äîeven the team might not have full visibility over this at the moment.
Feasibility in the Given Timeline:
Even for someone with a technical background, it‚Äôs difficult to troubleshoot and experiment across so many cases within the current timeline. Trying different approaches per question isn‚Äôt always feasible before the deadline.
I genuinely hope someone is able to complete
all 57 questions
successfully‚ÄîI‚Äôd love to learn from their experience and solutions.
Again, this post is meant in a positive and constructive spirit. If anything I said seems inappropriate or off the mark, please let me know‚ÄîI‚Äôm happy to edit or delete the post if needed.
Thank you for the learning opportunity

GA4 - Question 9: Process PDF Files
A similar issue occurs in GA4 Question 9, where the task involves processing PDF files. While this works perfectly in the local environment, it leads to a
502 Bad Gateway
error on Azure. This is due to the relatively long time required to parse and analyze the PDFs, which again exceeds Azure‚Äôs execution time limit.
Moreover, pre-processing the PDF files is not an option because the input varies for each user. Therefore, the PDFs must be processed dynamically, which adds to the delay and contributes to the timeout problem.
@carlton
I watched the last session. In that session, regarding the specific PDF question, you mentioned that the PDF is the same for everyone, so it can be preprocessed beforehand. However, I checked and found that the PDF is actually different for each user. So, we need to fetch it from the API endpoint.
How should we handle the timeout issue on the deployment platform? I even tried upgrading the plan, but it didn‚Äôt help.
@s.anand
@carlton
@Jivraj
Also, many questions and doubts were addressed in the last two sessions. I can improve a lot and add the remaining questions, but the constraint is the 31st March deadline. Most students, including myself, will only get time after 30th March due to Viva and OPPE.
It would be really helpful if the TDS team could extend the deadline.
I believe it would strike a good balance‚Äîteam made us wait for the Project 1 results, but extending the Project 2 deadline would make up for that for some extent. Its request nothing else.

Hello sir,
My question is, the questions my endpoint will be evaluated are they the exact same ones with same parameters for my respective email as on the assignment portal ?
Essentially I am trying to understand there are certain questions where I don‚Äôt have to solve the question again and just return the hardcoded answers, would that be correct ?

[2025-03-28T17:08:40.422Z] Saransh Saini (@Saransh_Saini: Course TA)
The API request would be sent containing the question text and the JSON file/files as a binary stream.

Hi
@22f3002933
Files are less likely to change, but parameters are. For instance, GA1_Q12, the zip file is less likely to change but the symbols to perform the aggregate on would be changed.

[2025-03-28T17:34:15.676Z] Saransh Saini (@Saransh_Saini: Course TA)
Hi
@lakshaygarg654
,
Yes for GA4_Q9 the PDF files are different for everyone, but the workflow is exactly the same. Its a basic tabula read, with no particular need of any preprocessing. So, yeah you have to fetch it from the API request.
Unfortunately, we can‚Äôt extend Project 2 deadline, it was released on 3rd of March, and we believe ample amount of time was given for it. If you are lagging far behind in the race, we would encourage you to collaborate with other and get the project done.

[2025-03-28T17:37:01.640Z] Dhruv (@22f3002933)
Thanks for the answer sir.
I remember being told on the last session, that the question will be exactly the same we have on the assignment portal for my respective case, and the answer on the portal can be the same here as well.
Actually I am exploring a hardcoded answer route where if i return the answer which I already got after solving the questions on the portal (in certain qns with dynamic functions) , so thought of asking if method is alright.

[2025-03-28T17:51:51.783Z] Saransh Saini (@Saransh_Saini: Course TA)
Yes sending your GA answer as text as the JSON response can work if the question was not parameterized. I hope you are aware that parameters for some questions will be changed, resulting in different answers.

[2025-03-28T17:54:02.456Z] LAKSHAY (@lakshaygarg654)
Thanks for your reply

I‚Äôve figured out the solution to that particular question.
The deadline is still a concern, as many issues were only resolved during recent sessions‚Äîsimilar to the project 1 workflow‚Äîand This time there are many other things in the pipeline ( viva‚Äôs and oppe‚Äôs )
Anyway, I will complete this course with valuable learnings, but many others have been seriously affected by it.

It is given that only one file arguement is passed , can there be a usecase where multiple files are sent , for example GA-5 10th question Image reconstruction where there could be one file be the image another could be separate file with mapping, Although mapping can be given with question as well,
But still can you please confirm if there will be only one file or there can be multiple files send to API?

Hello Sir,
I want to express my gratitude for the opportunity to work on this project. I have developed a mini chatbot backend using
vicky_server.py
, which handles question matching and execution internally, producing appropriate responses.
My mini chatbot is capable of creating its own API using REST and can manage tasks such as image compression, repository management, workflows, and web scraping related to graded assignments. It can even calculate total marks for subjects like physics and convert PDFs into markdown content. Additionally, it is capable of downloading the Llama model and creating a tunnel using ngrok. Essentially, it can address the first four assignment questions.
However, there are some limitations to this project. Currently, it processes my local files instead of the uploaded PDFs. I am working on resolving this issue, but I have some confusion regarding the internal handling of uploaded files. When I pass a PDF or file through an upload method, how should the system proceed? I want to ensure that the file is treated as a PDF for the user rather than just being referenced as ‚Äúquestion.pdf.‚Äù How can I effectively manage this problem?
Furthermore, there is an issue with question matching. At times, the system incorrectly identifies questions containing the word ‚Äúcode‚Äù and executes
first.py
for GA1.
Thank you for the opportunity to work on this project!
Best regards,
vicky kumar

Hi
@lakshaygarg654
In both the scenarios you laid out, the second implementation is correct. Your response to our API request should be a JSON object
{"answer" : "YOUR RESPONSE AS STRING"}
. In any case the value of the
"answer"
key should be a string.

[2025-03-29T14:49:52.418Z] Saransh Saini (@Saransh_Saini: Course TA)
Hosting it anywhere is fine. Try to deploy on vercel first, if that doesn‚Äôt succeed you can use any other hosting technique.

WILL NOT

Can you please give an example of how questions of this GA will be sent in the request, especially any of Q1 or Q2 or Q5 or Q6 or Q7 or Q8 which have code-blocks containing text crucial to the question? I just want to decide whether regex or function-calling would be more appropriate here.
GA4:
The links to the website are hyperlinks in the questions. When the question will be sent to my app, will the link of the website to be scraped be written as a full link in the question itself or will it be sent in some other way?

key in the JSON object.
{ "answer" : "YOUR_STRINGIFIED_ANSWER" }

We will take Q1 in this format, which is just copy pasting from portal```
One of the test cases involves sending a sample piece of meaningless text:
au7BK3 33 H 5   lKz6y4n  oQmbgoX 0  hNW3JH  68Q1u
Write a Python program that uses
httpx
to send a POST request to OpenAI‚Äôs API to analyze the sentiment of this (meaningless) text into GOOD, BAD or NEUTRAL. Specifically:
Make sure you pass an Authorization header with dummy API key.
Use
gpt-4o-mini
as the model.
The first message must be a system message asking the LLM to analyze the sentiment of the text. Make sure you mention GOOD, BAD, or NEUTRAL as the categories.
The second message must be
exactly
the text contained above.
This test is crucial for DataSentinel Inc. as it validates both the API integration and the correctness of message formatting in a controlled environment. Once verified, the same mechanism will be used to process genuine customer feedback, ensuring that the sentiment analysis module reliably categorizes data as GOOD, BAD, or NEUTRAL. This reliability is essential for maintaining high operational standards and swift response times in real-world applications.
Note
: This uses a dummy
httpx
library, not the real one. You can only use:
response = httpx.get(url, **kwargs)
response = httpx.post(url, json=None, **kwargs)
response.raise_for_status()
response.json()

As per the portal, we have to return a JSON object as a response from the API. However, if we load a JSON object directly using
json.load()
, it will throw an error. We need to first convert it into a JSON string and then load it using
json.loads( )
. For clarity I add image below.
This question has been stretched for too long‚Äîit‚Äôs not that big.

Subject: Request for Uniform Evaluation Process in Project 2 - TDS Solver.
Hello
@s.anand
@carlton
@Jivraj
@Saransh_Saini
sir.
We truly appreciate the effort you put into designing and evaluating our graded assignments and projects. We understand that any five random questions will be selected for evaluation, and we fully respect this approach.
However, we kindly request that the same set of five questions be used for all students to ensure a uniform and unbiased evaluation process. This way, the difficulty level remains consistent across all evaluations, providing a fair assessment of our understanding.
Thank you for considering our request. We appreciate your guidance and support.
Best regards,
Digvijaysinh Chudasama.

I just wanted to bring to your attention that in GA4 question 2, the answer evaluation script expects the movie title as ‚Äú17. Kraven: The Hunter‚Äù but it is actually listed on the IMDb page as ‚Äú17. Kraven the Hunter‚Äù, resulting in the correct one being marked wrong.
No questions here just wanted to bring it to attention so that it does not affect the project evaluation script.

Its unusual to have a docker container worth 7 GBs of space. Here is what you can do
Remove unused libraries from your
requirements.txt
. Sometimes having resource demanding libraries like
SentenceTransformers
can install large sub-dependency packages.
Exclude your virtual environment folder from the container creation
Create a
.containerignore
file to have an exception for those folders you want to skip.
Clear your package cache and any vscode cache you might have.

In the previous replies, you‚Äôve mentioned that for Github questions ‚Üí actions, pages (GA2) that if the email changes for everyone it means that its parameterised. However, in one of the live sessions this week, Carlton had mentioned that for these questions, it wont be parameterised as this is very individual specific. The same goes for the docker hub question of GA2 as well. KIndly clarify on the same.
For GA2 Q9 ‚Üí I have given an input file via post request and my fastapi server can handle get requests and its as follows. Kindly confirm if my url is good to go for this specific question.

and is your internal server capable of extracted from given location or we have to handle this internally

[2025-03-30T18:48:14.413Z] Saransh Saini (@Saransh_Saini: Course TA)
I am going to clarify this once and for all
The response should be a
JSON Object
with the value of the
"answer"
key as a string.
{ "answer" : "YOUR_ANSWER_AS_STRING" }
This is the way we are expecting your responses.
However, due to the heavy confusion among students and will be considering responses with entire JSON objects stringified. We don‚Äôt want anyone to loose their marks for such a miniscule error.
So,
"{\"answer\": \"YOUR_ANSWER\"}"
is also valid.

[2025-03-30T18:51:29.134Z] Vicky Kumar (@Algsoch)
means {‚Äòanswer‚Äô:‚ÄòE://data science too//GA5/output/vicky.jpg‚Äô} right or we have to do you said output as base64

[2025-03-30T18:51:45.855Z] Saransh Saini (@Saransh_Saini: Course TA)

We should receive your images as base64 encoded within your response JSON object.

No, we won‚Äôt be able to access your images from your local machine address.

Sir, I have an issue in GA5 Q3
What is the number of successful GET requests for pages under
/telugu/
from
11:00
until before
20:00
on Mondays?
For this, I have used two python scripts to get the answer, one written completely by me and another from someone else‚Äôs solution; both give the same answer -
2698
However, the portal says it‚Äôs incorrect. No modifications resulting in different answer are being accepted either and the modifications themselves seem to break the bounds of the question.
Please check the scripts and tell me where I am going wrong.
My script:
import subprocess
from datetime import datetime

def isDay(dtobj, day):
  return dtobj.weekday() == day

def isTime(dtobj, l, u):
  return l <= dtobj.hour < u

step1 = subprocess.run("cat data | grep -i 'GET /telugu/'", capture_output=True, shell=True, text=True)
subprocess.run("rm -f forstep2.txt", shell=True)
with open('forstep2.txt', 'a') as f:
  for line in step1.stdout.splitlines():
    try:
      status = int(line.split()[8])
    except Exception as e:
      status = 400
    if 200 <= status < 300:
      f.write(line + '\n')
step2 = subprocess.run("cat forstep2.txt | cut -d ' ' -f4", capture_output=True, shell=True, text=True)
count = 0
for line in step2.stdout.splitlines():
  log_datetime = datetime.strptime(line.strip('['), "%d/%b/%Y:%H:%M:%S")
  if(isDay(log_datetime, 0) and isTime(log_datetime, 11, 20)):
    count += 1

count
I had extracted and uploaded the
data
after extraction using gzip into colab and then executed the script.
The other script:

    # Filter conditions
    filtered_df = df[
        (df["method"] == "GET") &
        (df["url"].str.startswith("/telugu/")) &
        (df["status"] >= 200) & (df["status"] < 300) &
        (df["day_of_week"] == "Monday") &
        (df["hour"] >= 11) &

    ]

    print("Successful GET requests for /telugu/ on Mondays (11:00-7:59 AM):", len(filtered_df))
else:
    print("No log data available for processing.")
Both give the same output: 2698. Please help me identify the error, if any.

What is the request timeout for each question, especially for the question on YouTube video transcription? I request the timeout to be at least 40-60 seconds as yt-dlp and faster-whisper take take to download the audio, load the model and run it on cpu and get the transcription.
For 259.7 to 351.8 seconds, it is taking around 1.5 mins, but it is giving the correct answer.
So I request you to shorten the length of the audio or increase the request timeout or both in moderation.
Question ‚Äî> the ‚Äúquestion‚Äù sent to the api will have the youtube video link, right? Or since the video is same for everyone, can I just have the audio file ready in the project? Will the api be tested against any YouTube video other than the Mystery Story Audiobook link given in the GA question?
Edit: Even with a preprocessed audio file (mp3, speech optimized, 32K), what‚Äôs taking the longest time is joining the transcribed sentences into a single string. That alone is taking >50 seconds. Please suggest a way to make it faster.

I have deployed the project on render so the first request in evaluation takes around 50 to 60 second is that okay

I deployed my API using Railway.app, but Jio ISP is blocking requests to

. I tested it with five other ISPs, and the API endpoint works perfectly. Could you please consider that some ISPs may be blocking certain domains?

[2025-03-31T13:16:16.859Z] Saransh Saini (@Saransh_Saini: Course TA)
We‚Äôll try to keep this in consideration while developing the evaluation script. But to be on the safer side keep sending requests to your server on such intervals that it doesn‚Äôt go inactive.

Please extend the deadline for TDS Project 2. The MAD 1 project and two OPPEs have taken up all my time. I have completed my TDS project up to the Week 3 assignment solutions, and only two weeks remain to complete Weeks 4 and 5.

[2025-03-31T13:30:11.134Z] Jivraj Singh Shekhawat (@Jivraj: Course TA)

[2025-03-31T13:36:44.642Z] Vishal Baraiya (@TheVishal)
I completely understand the need to keep evaluations on schedule. In that case, would it be possible to grant just a one-day extension? I‚Äôve completed up to Week 3 and just need a little extra time to wrap up Weeks 4 and 5 properly. A single day would really help me submit a more polished project without causing significant delays

I noticed that ngrok disconnects after two hours, so I‚Äôm wondering if we can continue using it.
If your team was aware of this, I‚Äôd like to understand why it was allowed to deploy on ngrok. I typically use Vercel for deployment, but as you know, Vercel doesn‚Äôt support certain features.
what to do now

My project is hosted on render, because vercel refuses to cooperate with me, as a result the free version of render takes a minute to respond, and not only that but might also give internal server error until the 2nd or 3rd try. There is nothing I can do to change this except for maybe sending requests every now and then like it was suggested for another student using render. I just want to know if this is okay for evaluation.

please reply me.
What is this going on? Is it joking? Our teachers don‚Äôt have enough time to make a separate video for project to explain what to do and how to do? I already have done two project courses and they taught us, even they made 2 - groups just only for discussions in which one is personal and also made a YouTube playlist especially for project. They explained what should be your approach? How to make project? And here, they took only one session just only for show off. And they organised that single session when too many student requests too many times? Are we studying in IIT - The top institute of India or in a cheap and lower than third class government schools. It is the responsibility of our teachers to explain the project, but they are just showing off. Even they never provided the solutions for assignments also. Is it not our right to get solutions so that we can know where we did mistake? They don‚Äôt have time to make solutions, they just made an assignment checker which checks the assignments automatically. I don‚Äôt think so that they really made any effort in our course. In project-2 also, we need solutions for all graded assignments and so many students request for solutions but our the great teachers ignores the request and didn‚Äôt provide the solutions. I think they provide the projects whatever comes in their dreams during sleeping. In weekly study material, don‚Äôt have their notes, even they have a very few videos made by them, they just render to other YouTuber‚Äôs Youtube videos and online websites. Are we paid just only for these YouTube videos ? If we can understand everything just only from YouTube then why we are studying from the India‚Äôs top Engineering institute - The IIT Madras? I have much more better videos than that are provided on YouTube and created by other YouTubers. They only have some points copy pasted from documentations, but they never tried to explain them. Just read, copy and paste in your program. What is it, why it is used for, don‚Äôt ask anything.
Some students request for extending the time limit of [roject-2 just only for one day, but what was their excuse- "We won‚Äôt be able to extend deadline, if we do, then evaluations will get delayed. ". I want to ask them, where is the result of Project-1? The first date of result declaration was 26-Feb, then their another date was 16-March, but until now on 2-Apr, we do not get our results. It is more than 45 days, what is this going on? Nobody tried to ask with our great teachers. But on extending the deadline of project-2 just only for one day, their evaluation will be late. In project-2, we have to continue running our project until they will not evaluate, whether they take more than 1, 2 or more months. Either we have to host online by paying or run our own system for 24x7 unto when, we also don;t know as their result date is also not fixed, it is just a combination of letters and numbers showing on portal. It is our tales it is my right to get solutions for every weekly assignment, but don‚Äôt ask them to make efforts. Just pay and do assignments at own risk even you have not understand anything from the copy-pasted material. Just use AI‚Äôs or read whatever and wherever you want to read.
It is my kind request, our term is going to be completed, but please make some efforts in next term.
Thankyou to all my respected ‚ÄòThe Great Teachers‚Äô.

hi,
I dont share your views.
i feel it was one of the best course in whole of Diploma.
I have learned a lot in these projects and even in ROE preparation.
all the things we are learning here are open in market and the course contents are great direction towards learning and practicing them.
I agree it is stessful, my whole team were in a 9-hour g-meet call on Saturday night. but we have found solutions, shared ideas, try-outs, made fun of each other.
but at the end of the day we all agree that we have learnt lots of new things.
Regarding Project1 delay: if we think, atleast 1GB of docker image per students for 700+ students. even if parallalize the execution 5 students at a time you still need a very powerfull system to download and amount of data downloading etc‚Ä¶ At the end of the day we got a very good result and report with logs to verify
for GA‚Äôs: it is upto you to copy solutions or learn something out of each GA sections
All in all I am happy with the course.

Dear Shahzada,
You joined Discourse almost a year ago Jun 8th, 2023. In all that time you have read 832 posts. And never interacted with anyone on discourse. You finally decided to interact once and that was today and this is your first post (your second if we count that you deleted your first post)
The first step to receiving help is communication. If you do not communicate, no one can help you.
23f2002668:
What is this going on? Is it joking?
I am not sure what your question is. I am not sure what you are referring to. Please be clear in your questions.
23f2002668:
Our teachers don‚Äôt have enough time to make a separate video for project to explain what to do and how to do?
We have made
several hours of videos
on Project 2 and have demonstrated multiple ways to solve it. However, we are not going to ever create it for you. We do teach you all the core technologies you can leverage to create it yourself.
23f2002668:
I already have done two project courses and they taught us, even they made 2 - groups just only for discussions in which one is personal and also made a YouTube playlist especially for project.
Not sure which courses you are referring to, but those are standalone courses. Here project is part of the course and is meant to take you roughly a few days to create. We gave students more than one month for Project 1 and the solution for it takes a few hours to create. (which we have shared)
23f2002668:
They explained what should be your approach? How to make project?
Yes these were explained if you
either took part in any live session or
watched the recorded video
23f2002668:
And here, they took only one session just only for show off. And they organised that single session when too many student requests too many times?
I am not sure what you are referring to because several sessions were conducted for Project 2 spanning nearly 2 weeks.
23f2002668:
It is the responsibility of our teachers to explain the project, but they are just showing off.
Project 2 was explained. I can summarise it in these words:
Create a server api that receives a request.
The request would be any question from the first 5 GAs.
The response has to be a json response as specified in the Project page.
Multiple demonstrations were done of this workflow in sessions.
23f2002668:
Even they never provided the solutions for assignments also. Is it not our right to get solutions so that we can know where we did mistake?
Since this is your first post, you‚Äôve never ever asked for solutions to any assignments. We have never provided solution notebooks for TDS. It defeats the learning process.
If you want solutions, there are several options:
Ask for help (since you have never posted before, you missed the opportunity to receive it)
Collaborate with others (a bigger goal of TDS, because in the real world one man bands almost certainly fail with extremely high probability, barring a few exceptions, human progress is built on collaboration)
Join live sessions, where we have provided solutions to almost every assignment question that students have asked (and not asked)
Watch the live sessions, we have even created neat Q & A summaries for them on the TDS portal (something which no other subject does at the moment)
23f2002668:
They don‚Äôt have time to make solutions, they just made an assignment checker which checks the assignments automatically.
This is one of the most loved features by our students. No other GA in any other course gives you the option to check your answers in real time and better yet correct them before submitting.
The biggest clue for solutions is in this nugget. If you take the opportunity, and enterprise and get some fellow students together, you are actually able to obtain the solution script from the GA page itself. It takes some effort, but that is how learning occurs‚Ä¶ with effort. Studies repeatedly show that zero effort results in nearly zero learning.
23f2002668:
Are we paid just only for these YouTube videos ? If we can understand everything just only from YouTube then why we are studying from the India‚Äôs top Engineering institute - The IIT Madras? I have much more better videos than that are provided on YouTube and created by other YouTubers.
If you had better resources available, you have hardly been the paragon of virtue, because we always encourage people to share their learnings. We learn from you, just as you learn from us. If someone makes a better video than us and give it for free, we are happy enough to learn from them. Why should we reinvent a video that is poor quality and force students to watch it when there are better videos? We are not so egoistic to take that approach and worse it does not benefit our students to satisfy our ego. There are a million videos out there on you Tube, how do you find the best one? We curate it. So that you do not have to spend hours finding a good video.
But feel free to find better videos. More power to you, but what would be even better? Share with others so that we can build each other up.
What are the best videos to learn linear algebra? Probably MIT. Why bother with substandard videos when you can just get the best for free? Its just that watching MIT videos will not give you an undergraduate degree from MIT. And it costs Rs. 2.7 crores, provided you even get a seat in the first place. Here you get a 4 year degree for Rs 3.5 lakhs. So you are paying for that.
I absolutely 100% agree with you, if you think you can get a better degree for Rs 3.5 Lakhs then definitely do that. There is no point in wasting time and money on something that is not delivering good value to you.
23f2002668:
They only have some points copy pasted from documentations, but they never tried to explain them. Just read, copy and paste in your program. What is it, why it is used for, don‚Äôt ask anything.
Reading documentation is a skill you have to pick up.
Having said that, we have always explained something that students have asked.
Just ask anyone who attended the sessions. More significantly, most of the new things we learnt, were self taught. Unless you pick up this lifelong habit, you will struggle in the real world.
Now is a good time to start.
23f2002668:
Some students request for extending the time limit of [roject-2 just only for one day, but what was their excuse- "We won‚Äôt be able to extend deadline, if we do, then evaluations will get delayed. "
That is correct. We do not want to evaluations for Project 2 to be delayed as end term is very close. Is your complaint that you want evaluations to be delayed? Also its not an excuse. Its a fact. Delaying submissions, delays evaluations. Its just basic logic.
23f2002668:
I want to ask them, where is the result of Project-1?
They have already been sent to all those who passed the prerequisites. Yours did not pass the first time.
Luckily for you,
our first priority is always to do our best for students. So not being satisfied with the validation script that was run which was stricter, we created a new one that was more forgiving. You should get a 0 based on the stricter criteria, but you passed on our more lenient check and now you will soon be getting a normalised 7/20 score (we have not decided the normalisation yet because its a matter of deciding how lenient to be).
23f2002668:
The first date of result declaration was 26-Feb, then their another date was 16-March, but until now on 2-Apr, we do not get our results. It is more than 45 days, what is this going on? Nobody tried to ask with our great teachers.
If you had attended the live session you would have seen Anand explain the reason for the delay. And we do not mind when students ask why and we freely tell them why. So I do not understand how you came to this conclusion.
23f2002668:
In project-2, we have to continue running our project until they will not evaluate, whether they take more than 1, 2 or more months. Either we have to host online by paying or run our own system for 24x7 unto when, we also don;t know as their result date is also not fixed, it is just a combination of letters and numbers showing on portal.
Anand invited students to write the evaluation script in his live session. And since you claim it is so easy you could have written it and gotten full marks. I am not sure why you did not take this easy option. You complained about it, but decided not to create a solution?
Also if you watched the sessions, we never asked you to run your server for 2 months or 1 month  etc. Its generally a bad idea to make assumptions that have no basis in reality. Project 2 is easy to evaluate. We expect it will take a few days, possibly by this weekend to finish evaluation and push a score. So why you came to the conclusion it would take months, is a mystery, given that you already rightfully explained that its easy to write a script.
But validation takes time. We want to make sure there are no bugs and errors and a lot of edges are possible when students are running various deployments. So we want to give them the best chance of actually scoring. Unless you prefer we do a rush job and give them zeros. You would have received a zero in your project 1 had we not caught a few edge cases in our testing regime.
You can take a poll and ask fellow students if they prefer your approach. We are always happy to make changes based on feedback.
23f2002668:
It is my kind request, our term is going to be completed, but please make some efforts in next term.
Thankyou to all my respected ‚ÄòThe Great Teachers‚Äô.
I am glad you decided make a kind request, although by all the personal insults and attacks and your ending sign off its clear that neither
respect
nor
kindness
is evident in your post.
But thank you for your feedback.
One final note: Do interact more, its healthy. We make mistakes, and we learn. There are many things we want fix for next term. Its not at all our desire to delay evaluations. The complexity of project 1 evaluations was unexpected. So we do apologise for that. We have done so repeatedly, even in our sessions and in discourse posts. The scripts that we released for everyone, probably showed how challenging it was to get it right so that everyone who could get a score, got a score.
And when writing posts or emails or any communication, try to stay on point and professional. We are always happy to learn what we can change and improve.
Kind regards,
TDS team

Hi, I have a few things to say
My background :
I have completed all the courses in diploma except TDS. I have secured reasonably good grades in all the courses. However, I failed TDS the last term and I am likely to fail in this term too. The reason is, I got bad marks in both ROE and I have never submitted any project, i.e., I have not submitted 3 TDS projects in the last two terms and did badly in the first project of the previous term.
My Initial Disappointments with this Course
In one of the orientation session, I heard Andrew sir say this (subject to correction):
The video lectures are the primary content. It is not compulsory to attend the live sessions, but it is highly recommended.
Here, the most important resource are the live sessions. I did not like it. Till now, I have managed all the courses with faculty lectures alone. I rarely watch live sessions. I didn‚Äôt like watching live sessions. I felt it was against what is pointed out in the previous paragraph
ROE is just for forty five minutes, with around 10 questions. I felt that this is rubbish and unthoughtful.
There are not many videos explaining the tools (from IIT side). Only a few videos. Most of the tools are explained through text. I felt that a the purpose of a college course is to explain things in a simple way so that we can learn it easily.
Why did I fail?
Last Term
I dumped myself with a 3 more courses, projects and nptel courses. I didn‚Äôt practice the GAs properly. So I failed ROE. I will come to the projects soon.
This term.
I made sure that I do all the GAs properly. But I did better than last time in ROE but still bad. This time because, other than GAs, I didn‚Äôt allocate time for ROE. Also, I didn‚Äôt submit both the projects.
In both the terms I didn‚Äôt collaborate with anyone. I felt that I shouldn‚Äôt earn my marks be talking help from someone. I felt it is not fair.
Me Understanding about the Course Now
This one line changed my view about ROE.
On another topic
What does this RoE evaluate?
Implicit learning.
I am reasonably ok with python and all the tools in this course. But in ROE, I was not able to write a nested for loop, which was needed for some question. It is not that I don‚Äôt know how to write a simple nested loop. I discovered the fact that I have not coded enough.
I scored 100 in all the OPPEs : python, java, PDSA, DBMS. I knew the concepts. But the questions were not difficult and the time was ample. This is not the case in TDS.
Now I realize that  I am not good in SQL or DSA. It is just the questions were easy and was accompanied with ample time.
In MLP, I score just 40 in OPPE 1, this was because of me not practicing
SKLearn
. Then I practiced and got 90 in the second OPPE.
This course has made me realise that till I need to learn relearn these things in an
implicit
way.
This is the exact reason why I have not been able to complete the projects. I still know most of the things required for project 1 and 2. But I was not able to practically sit and write the code.
I have understood that this is not a traditional course. I feel that we must expect something different from this course. Especially not just marks
I have understood that the limited amount of recorded lectures for is a way to make the students to practically go through the documentation. Understand the complex phrasing of some functionalities, etc.
I am most likely to take this course again. I feel extremely bad to have wasted 15000 rupees. But this course has been a wake up call for me. I still feel that I have the potential to do this course way better than this. What I would have to do is a lot more coding of what I have already learnt.
From the other project courses, I had a wrong assumption that projects are about applying what we have learnt. This was also a reason why I didn‚Äôt do my projects in TDS. I felt that the course team didn‚Äôt cover all the essentials of a projects. I have now realized that projects are about applying what we know and also learn new things which will enhance our projects.
Since this is not a traditional course, I also feel that it is fine to collaborate and seek help, at the same time, strive to contribute to others too.
Thanks to
@s.anand
,
@carlton
,
@Jivraj
and
@Saransh_Saini
Just two suggestions
I feel that MAD 2 and MLP should be corequisites.
While introducing the projects, kindly include a video where the flow of the project is explained. Also, address few questions in the video itself which are likely to be asked by us.

Evaluations will start before this weekend, with some sampling done possibly even tonight and most evaluation runs tomorrow.
Also we will prime the target first by sending a dummy request so it gets ‚Äúwarmed up‚Äù because some of you have reported time to respond to first request takes time for the server to spin up.
Then once we know its responding, we will send requests for evaluation.

sir, I have noticed that sometimes our vm based application gets stuck and on verifying every request using FastApi have noticed that best way to check is run and get your answer post that RESET it back and then run another query and it works perfectly fine, not sure have other faced this issue or not, but it would be great if you could take note of this while evaluating just for safety.
Hope you take note of this and take this into consideration.

Okay so basically sometimes what happens is while verifying on FASTApi ‚Äì it gives errors like missing paramaters like‚Ä¶ So basically sometimes it needs resetting the request parser and then it works perfectly fine.
{
  "detail": "execute() missing 1 required positional argument: 'file_bytes'"
}
Which is incorrect, so if we press the RESET button and execute it works properly.

The way we test your api is
not through a front end.
We send a request to the endpoint directly. We have demoed it in live sessions.
We have even posted on discourse snippets of what this looks like.
As long as your endpoint responds to a request that we send, it will be fine.
Kind regards

Dear
@Carlton
and
@S.Anand
,
I successfully deployed my project on Vercel, and it works perfectly when tested using curl commands. Each task installs its required packages and runs as expected. However, I encountered an issue with Vercel‚Äôs free version, which has a 250MB limit. While my project‚Äôs size without installed packages is approximately 34MB, the size exceeds the limit once packages like Pandas, NumPy, Pillow, Whisper, and Uvicorn are installed, causing the server to crash.
Could you kindly suggest any alternatives or solutions for this issue? I would greatly appreciate your guidance, as I fear all my hard work might go to waste without a resolution.

[2025-04-04T06:15:47.759Z] Carlton D'Silva (@carlton: Regular)
We are in the processing pipeline. You will have to wait till it completes. Basically if your endpoint works when we send it a request you will be evaluated. We will use the timestamp of your latest endpoint before the deadline.
Hope that answers your question.

[2025-04-04T06:17:36.098Z] Carlton D'Silva (@carlton: Regular)
The alternative is to use vercel purely as an endpoint service that processes most things without large libraries, and for more heavy duty backend work forwards the request to another system that handles it and sends it back to your vercel function which then relays the answer to the request.

[2025-04-04T06:24:18.228Z] Aarush saxena  (@23f2005702)
in spreadsheet edit response modify previous response with timestamp, how you can access that timestamp response?? So how can u have my end point before deadline one since i updated it after deadline.
Also the before deadline one end point is
/api which i changed to /api/ after deadline so if u somehow have access to my old url pls consider adding 1 (slash) / :')

[2025-04-04T06:31:22.509Z] Aarush saxena  (@23f2005702)
I understand your point but what I am saying is that when I edited my end point after deadline it changed my timestamp to after deadline one so that is my concern that my submission might not be even considered

[2025-04-04T06:31:57.450Z] Carlton D'Silva (@carlton: Regular)
you can have multiple submissions with multiple timestamps in gform. (unless you chose to edit your response, in that situation i have not tested what actually happens).

From Problem to Platform: Building ‚ÄúVicky‚Äù ‚Äì A Smart Data Science Assistant for TDS @ IIT Madras
Project Demo Website
:
https://app.algsoch.tech
During our college course
Tool for Data Science (TDS)
at
IIT Madras
, we were tasked with a challenging but exciting project:
to build a platform that can take in natural language questions and execute corresponding solutions through an API
.
The Mission:
Create a tool that behaves like a
chatbot
, accepts
user queries (text or file-based)
via
web or API
, processes them intelligently,
executes the appropriate code
, and returns accurate results‚Äîlike a real data science assistant.
The Journey: From Fails to Final
At first, the natural choice was to try
LLM agents
‚Äîthey sounded magical. But in real-world usage, they were slow, unreliable, and lacked precision. Most failed to parse or execute even moderately dynamic queries.
Then I thought‚Äîwhat if I manually mapped questions and answers using a
static JSON structure
? That quickly broke when users passed
different parameters, different files
, or queried in
non-standard formats
like ‚Äúcode -s‚Äù or ‚Äúcode -v‚Äù.
The next idea: write
individual Python scripts per question
from our Graded Assignments (GA1‚ÄìGA5). But that lacked flexibility and reusability. Creating multiple files became unmanageable and non-scalable.
The Breakthrough: Dynamic Function Mapping
After multiple iterations and failed prototypes, I finally found the right architecture:
Centralized engine in
vicky_server.py
Uses
regex-based pattern matching
to detect question types, extract parameters, and identify the correct solution
Each solution is a structured Python function like
ga1_first_solution(query=None)
Supports dynamic parameter injection, command-line variations, file-based queries, and more
Acts like a
mini compiler for data science tools
Presenting Vicky ‚Äì The Mini Chatbot for TDS
Vicky is a
smart, modular chatbot
built specifically for
Tool for Data Science at IIT Madras
. It‚Äôs packed with real functionality‚Äînot just templates.
Key Features:
Graded Assignment Solver
Handles dynamic, real-world questions from GA1 to GA5 like:
code -s
/
code -v
‚Üí VS terminal commands
Create FastAPI API for CSV with filtering/searching
GitHub automation: repo creation, GitHub Actions setup
Data cleaning, scraping from IMDb, image compression
File Upload with Query Matching
Users can upload a file (CSV, JSON, Excel) and ask file-specific queries. The system understands context and dynamically links the query to the uploaded file.
HTML Viewer + Base64 Decoder
View any website in rendered & source format using CORS proxy
Upload Base64 string ‚Üí Get original image back
Webhooks Integration
Live notifications via
Discord
&
Slack
whenever
/api
endpoints are accessed
Monitors
server status (online/offline)
and sends real-time updates
LLM Download + Auto Tunneling
Downloads LLaMA models
Dynamically finds available ports
Creates and exposes tunneled endpoints
Live Web UI at
app.algsoch.tech
Ask any TDS question
Upload and query with files
Image decoder
Graded assignment slider navigation
HTML viewer
API health status
Built With:
FastAPI
for blazing fast APIs
Regex & Pattern Matching
for dynamic input detection
GitHub Copilot
+ my Python debugging and architectural thinking
Full webhook and status monitoring system
Modular backend (
vicky_server.py
) and web frontend (
vicky_app.py
)
I want to extend a huge thank you to
@s.anand
for their guidance on this project. I‚Äôve learned what prompt engineering is and how we can leverage large language models (LLMs). One interesting takeaway is that while these technologies won‚Äôt replace our jobs‚Äîespecially for those who understand programming‚Äîthey will create new job opportunities instead.
Now I am capable of how fastapi work and more things and how to structure code and how to design code and most important what to think for project

Dear Sir,
I would like to clarify the situation regarding my previous submission. Initially, I provided an ngrok link, but due to an error with ngrok, it stopped working. I then found an alternative solution using Cloudflare with a custom domain that I obtained through the GitHub Student Pack. I successfully created a tunnel, and it is currently functional. I can shut down my laptop, and it still works with the same URL when I restart.
I hope you will consider my case. I submitted my work at that time because I learned about this solution from a fellow student on Discord. I only changed the URL and made no other modifications.
Thank you for your understanding

Hi
@carlton
The same issue has affected several of us. During the last Google Meet session, we explained the situation to
@Saransh_Saini
.
It seems that when we edit our responses, the timestamp with other values updates not submitted as new response. However, the position of the response in the form remains unchanged. For instance, we submitted our response at 11:30 PM on March 31st, and someone else submitted theirs at 11:45 PM. Even after editing our response the next day, our entry still appears above theirs.
We just wanted to clarify: Will responses edited or submitted on April 1st still be considered, given that the form remains open? If not, is there any way we can show proof of our original submission? Currently, we have email confirmations for both the initial and the edited responses.
We hope this won‚Äôt be a major issue, especially not on the level of Project 1 concerns. Looking forward to a positive resolution from the TDS team.
Thank you
Lakshay

Actually in the free tier there are many issues. These issues are beyond our control and I request the TDS team to please consider this issue and please consider re-evaluating it if it has not been done yet as we had put in a lot of efforts.

Hi

I re-ran evaluation on your endpoint, and it completed successfully.

sir
A lot of us have hosted on Azure and other platforms and were wondering by when we could expect project 2 marks so that we can take this down ? Could we have rough idea as to when the results will be available ?

, I believe you all have evaluated it. For me, there are some requests from a known IP with the following location details:
{'status': 'success', 'country': 'India', 'countryCode': 'IN', 'region': 'TN', 'regionName': 'Tamil Nadu', 'city': 'Chennai', 'zip': '600042', 'lat': 13.0895, 'lon': 80.2739, 'timezone': 'Asia/Kolkata', 'isp': 'IIT Madras', 'org': 'IITM', 'as': 'AS141340 IIT Madras', 'query': '103.158.43.17'}

The same thing has happened to me as the mentioned above. I also have not received request from Indian IP as far as I can see on the logs. I am using the azure VM itself.
I rechecked and maybe the server went offline, so I re-ran the script anyway and checked a few questions now and it works.
I think after a certain while it timed out for me(not entirely sure tho)‚Ä¶ but i fixed it.

Create a shell script that loops through the list of API endpoints and uses
curl
to send requests to each. You can pass headers, authentication tokens, or data as needed.

also want to know if we need to do any extra projects for the bonus marks.

Now that I‚Äôm back in Delhi, I‚Äôm connected to the internet, and I‚Äôm happy to report that my endpoint is working again.

@Saransh_Saini
Sir, I saw from the logs on Cloud Run that my project was probably evaluated on 5th April at around 11:51 PM and all the requests made during that time resulted in 3 response status codes: 302, 307 and 405 by no fault of my app, but rather errors in the request itself. I mentioned the exactly correct URL of my app in the form but the evaluation logs show three different types of URL to which request was made. As I mentioned in the form, my url is of the format ‚Äúhttps://‚Ä¶/api/‚Äù and allows only POST requests.
The app was supposed to allow POST requests and I allowed only POST requests, so GET requests even to correct url resulted in 405 response
When POST requests were actually made, two wrong urls were used for all the POST requests
a. http://‚Ä¶/api/ ‚Üí resulted in 302 response
b. https://‚Ä¶/api  ‚Üí resulted in a 307
whereas the url I gave was of the format ‚Äúhttps://‚Ä¶/api/‚Äù
The logs from Cloud Run
image
982√ó552 133 KB
As you can see from the above logs, all POST requests made to my app have the wrong url, some have only http and some end with ‚Äú/api‚Äù instead of ‚Äú/api/‚Äù, both of which do not match with the correct url I gave in the Google Form (screenshot attached below).

, it would be helpful if you could specify a date ‚Äî a clear deadline

[2025-04-08T11:08:59.316Z] Carlton D'Silva (@carlton: Regular)
We cant specify a clear deadline. If we could we would. At the present time there are roughly 100+ evals left in the pipeline. And we retry them to give students the best chance of getting a score. Sometimes we accomodate some unusual situations that we have been made aware of but all of those interrupt our workflows and so it takes time. Which makes this process a little unpredictable.
This is the first term where we have had students deploy solutions that require significant compute resources on our end to evaluate. So there was always going to be hickups. But i think that we have delivered an equally enriching learning experience as a result which is enough to land you an actual job. (Might not be so enriching on your CGPA admittedly, but thats a small price to pay for invaluable skills you hopefully have gained)

@Jivraj
Sir When i test it locally , my LLM is working fine , even running the app , it gave result in 2 sec ,
I dont know what happened in the logs , it was showing some runtime error ,
As i am using free plan of vercel , so it allow for 10 sec only ,
I think any heavy file being run , so it just take some more time , more than 10 sec , but inbuild feature of free plan allow to run only 10 sec ‚Ä¶ and thats why this happened , i guess
does it means , my LLM failed ??
Can you please try some other question , it will work , or even for heavy question it work ,
You can check its working from interface too
Please check once !!

But Sir please give some bonus , As in earlier terms , everyone got S grade in TDS , without doing anything , and from this term the difficulty level increased rapidly , just like e^x
Although I know that our LLM doesnt worked fully(100%) , but atleast they worked 50-60%
We have learned so many things  and try to implement in it too,‚Ä¶
Atleast give some bonus for our hardwork , and participating in both LLM project , so even we dont get S grade , but will get B , A , grade ‚Ä¶ and our CGPA doesn‚Äôt decrease much
because projects hold the major chunk in grading

It seems you have provided a local address endpoint, which means it will only work on your computer. If I run it on my computer, it will redirect to my port 8000 if it is running.

sir my roll number is 23f2004462
Due to an unexpected power outage, my PC shut down abruptly, causing my local server and ngrok tunnel to terminate. When the system rebooted, I restarted the server and ngrok, which generated a new API endpoint as ngrok URLs are temporary and change with every session. The previous endpoint is no longer accessible, and the new one now serves as the API endpoint. I understand the need for a consistent URL and will explore solutions like reserving a domain through ngrok‚Äôs paid plan to prevent such issues in the future. Apologies for any inconvenience caused, and thank you for understanding.

Respected sir, by mistake I have submitted the endpoint as :

while the corrected api which is deployed on vercel for direct requests is :
https://tds-project-2-peach.vercel.app/api/
The link provided is also working one but this link has the frontend part not the url endpoint.
kindly evaluate me on the basis of the updated link :

Respected Course Team,
Harsh this side from NIT Allahabad, I am writing to inform you that I received a notification

2096√ó1154 160 KB
regarding an issue with my submission.
I believe the issue may have occurred because I had mistakenly provided an incorrect API endpoint in my earlier submission. However, my server is still actively running on Vercel
https://tds-project-2-peach.vercel.app
and the correct API endpoint is:
correct api :
https://tds-project-2-peach.vercel.app/api/
Everything else in the project is functioning as expected. I kindly request you to re-evaluate my submission using the correct endpoint as i am currently in my 3rd year of BTech Chemical engineering at NIT Allahabad and my placement session is coming so i don‚Äôt want to get failed in this course due to such a small mistake.
Thank you for your understanding and support.

I just got the mail stating that my evaluation is complete and I can turn off my server.
However the Cloud Run logs show that all POST requests were made to the wrong end point.
The exact url I gave ends with ‚Äú/api/‚Äù but every POST request was either made to ‚Äú/api‚Äù which resulted in a 307 response or with ‚Äúhttp‚Äù instead of ‚Äúhttps‚Äù which resulted in a 302 response. Only the get requests were made to the correct endpoint but since the app was supposed to allow POST requests only, making GET requests just resulted in 405.

About 30 minutes ago, I received an email stating that project 2 has been evaluated. However, when I checked my IP stats, I found there is no special API access. You can verify this. I want to understand whether this is just a wrong email I received or if there is an issue with your system‚Äôs evaluation. Please clarify this doubt, as I am unable to focus on my final term exam.

as updated endpoint in google form on April 10th. Same day I had got around 9 requests on that endpoint around 4:56 PM. They were 200 OK requests on /api/ and 4 requests  were 307 redirect on /api. I presume they were from TDS team. Next day got email to shut off endpoint. I had tested endpoint locally and on ngrok. Both were fine. Was the updated endpoint in the google form evaluated?

sir ,
I am writing to kindly request a re-evaluation of my Project 2 submission. As I had previously mentioned, the Render deployment link I submitted may take approximately
50 to 60 seconds
to activate upon the first load. This behavior is typical of free-tier deployments on Render, and I assure you that the application functions correctly in both
Podman
and
Linux
environments.
Upon reviewing my Render logs, I could not find any indication that the project was accessed or evaluated during the expected activation time. To ensure smooth accessibility, I have also deployed the same GitHub repository on
Railway
and submitted that link as well.
If possible, I kindly request either of the following:
Re-evaluation using the
Railway link
I provided, or
Re-evaluation using the
Render link
, with allowance for the 50‚Äì60 second activation time.
Your consideration and understanding in this matter would be greatly appreciated. Please let me know if any further clarification or information is needed.
Thank you for your support and guidance.

Additionally, my Vercel server is still active, and the API is functioning correctly, as can be verified here:

Dear Sir,
In my course dashboard, Project 2 score is shown as zero. However, I had submitted the repository and API endpoints (
http://35.192.157.22.80

Dear Sir,
@carlton
@Jivraj
I need your immediate attention regarding my
project-2 , as I received zero marks,
but
my server is running completely fine
. Below are the key points that I need you to look into:
Server is running and reachable. and Giving The Correct Answers
GET and POST requests tested via Postman and VS Code, both return 200 OK.
Tested on my laptop and by 10+ other people ‚Äì all received correct results.
No issues seen in logs or deployment ‚Äì everything was set up properly.
Others in my group got full marks ‚Äì we worked on the same project.
I have no idea what went wrong during the evaluation.
I‚Äôve spent weeks working on this project, including sleepless nights.
Cant have least scores despite all the efforts.
Please recheck my project thoroughly. Here are the important links for you to verify:
API Documentation:
FastAPI - Swagger UI
I truly believe that my server is functioning as expected, and I just need a re-evaluation to confirm that.
I‚Äôve put in a lot of effort into this, and I sincerely request that you review it again.
Please don‚Äôt ignore this.
Thanks,

My marks are also showing as zero.
My suggestion is to provide students with the logs of your evaluation script, so we know if it is that server was not reachable, the answer is incorrect, or the response format was incorrect..etc
Request you to let us know if there is going to be re-evaluation so we can get the Azure instance running again

exactly
what you submitted .

[2025-04-16T12:42:49.199Z] Carlton D'Silva (@carlton: Regular)
You were not present in the form Anand gave us. It most likely because you submitted after the deadline (or made edits after the deadline, if the form he shared allowed edits).

I‚Äôm writing to clarify the status of my  Project 2, which is currently marked as ‚ÄúAbsent‚Äù. I would like to respectfully state that I
submitted the form before the deadline
‚Äî specifically on  31st March 2025 at 22:11 , and I have the  response copy as proof.
I would also like to emphasize that:
No edits were made to the form after submission.
I  did not make any changes to the project or submission after the deadline.
My  Vercel API is still active  and functioning as expected.
Here are the submitted links:
GitHub Repo:
GitHub - itskaiffazal/tdsproject2: Tools in data science Project 2 - TDS Solver
API Endpoint:
https://tdsproject2.vercel.app/api/
I kindly request you to review my submission  and take the necessary steps to update the status.

This situation is quite distressing for me, as it could result in a significant  setback, potentially requiring me to  repeat the entire course. I fully acknowledge that the mistake was mine ‚Äî a small yet critical one ‚Äî and I sincerely request that if there is even a slight possibility of evaluation, please consider it.

Respected Carlton Sir,
I thought in gform we need to submit the deployment url:
tdsproject2-eight.vercel.app
TDS Solver
but for the API testing we need to add /api/ to the url:
https://tdsproject2-eight.vercel.app/api/
Please do my evaluation on this link, its the same just we need to go to /api/ in the URL

Dear Sirs,
I apologize for the inconvenience caused by reaching out again. I came to know that many students have received an email stating that the re-evaluation for Project 2 will be conducted today between 11 PM and 2 AM. However, I have not received any such communication on my end.
I would like to bring to your attention that I actively helped several peers deploy their servers on Vercel and resolve various issues, and many of them received marks as high as 80. Unfortunately, my own record still shows as ‚ÄúAbsent,‚Äù despite the fact that I submitted the Google Form well before the deadline and my server has been live and running for over two weeks.
For your verification, I am attaching screenshots of my GitHub repository and the Vercel deployment dashboard, which clearly show the deployment.
I sincerely request you to kindly consider this issue. This situation has caused significant mental stress, especially as I had already faced a grading issue in Project 1. The anxiety and uncertainty around my Project 2 score have negatively affected my focus during the end-term exam and viva for other projects as well. Receiving a zero in this project would only further impact my overall performance and morale, despite the genuine effort I have put in.
I genuinely hope for a positive response and a fair re-evaluation.
Thank you very much for your time and understanding.

Respected Sir,
Sir I made a mistake while submitting the GFORM in hurry, I submitted the deployment URL instead of API URL:
currently for re-evaluation my URL that I received on my mail id is:
https://tdsproject2-eight.vercel.app/
but for API testing we need to add /api/ to the URL so final URL is:
https://tdsproject2-eight.vercel.app/api/
I‚Äôm sorry for this mistake sir, please accept this small change, we just need to add /api/ to the URL
Thank you
actually 2 of my friend had submitted similar url with no /api/ but he got 80 marks and I also submitted without /api/ url but I got 0 so for re evaluation sir please add /api/ to the original URL as mentioned Above Please Sir
Thank you

So anyone with an ngrok endpoint can send their new ngrok to us, but obviously you will need to start the server up much sooner than 11 in that case. An email will be sent to you specifically. DO NOT give us the endpoint on discourse. Reply to the email we will send specifically for you.

Request to Use Public DNS for Course Tool API Deployment or Use Alternate Endpoint
Dear
@Jivraj
@Saransh_Saini
@carlton
I hope you‚Äôre doing well!
I‚Äôm currently running my server and  trying to access the API hosted at:
https://sss-production-7a97.up.railway.app/api/
However, I‚Äôm encountering the following error:
curl: (6) Could not resolve host: sss-production-7a97.up.railway.app
After some investigation, I found that the issue is related to DNS resolution. The API becomes accessible when using
public DNS services
like
Google (8.8.8.8)
or
Cloudflare (1.1.1.1)
. This suggests that the current deployment environment may be using a restricted or unreliable DNS resolver, which causes access issues on some networks (e.g., Jio).
Suggested Fix:
To ensure reliable access for all students, could you please consider updating the deployment or testing environment to use a
public DNS
provider?
Recommended options:
Google DNS
:
8.8.8.8
,
8.8.4.4
Cloudflare DNS
:
1.1.1.1
,
1.0.0.1
This can typically be configured via Docker settings or the environment‚Äôs networking configuration.
Alternate Option:
If the DNS change isn‚Äôt possible at the moment, I kindly request that you evaluate my project using the
previously deployed endpoint
instead:
https://tds-project-2-pnlm.onrender.com/api/
Please note that this endpoint may take
50 to 60 seconds
to respond, as it‚Äôs hosted on a platform with a cold start delay ‚Äî but it is fully functional and provides the correct outputs.
Both endpoints are currently active and return identical results.
Thank you so much for your time and support ‚Äî I truly appreciate the effort you‚Äôre putting into helping us succeed in this course!
Best regards,
Sahil Raj

In the google form which we submitted I had pasted the API endpoint as the one which I got in the vercel dashboard i.e.
https://tds-project2-rho.vercel.app/
whereas the correct api for giving post requests has
/api
added to the above which i forgot to add. i.e**.
https://tds-project2-rho.vercel.app/api/**
I have checked again and the post requests are working.
I know that I made a mistake in the form and regret the same. If possible, please evaluate my project 2 with  the above endpoint

Hi Jivraj,
I would like to draw attention to a specific question regarding the process of creating an HTML file and publishing it to GitHub. I notice that I am not providing a preloaded answer when this question arises. Instead, it creates a new repository and an HTML file, then deploys it on GitHub. Initially, it presents a URL, but I understand that your server checks to verify whether the URL contains valid HTML. This verification process takes time, which can lead to an incorrect response when checking the URL right after deployment.
At that moment, the URL might not display the HTML content or be verified by your server, even though eventually, the deployment is successful and the URL is correct. Please keep in mind that publishing to GitHub requires some time; it‚Äôs not feasible to expedite this process drastically, to my knowledge.
I checked and noted that this question has been asked recently.
Additionally, I believe the image may show your server‚Äôs IP address.
Thank you!

[2025-04-16T19:59:13.671Z] Jivraj Singh Shekhawat (@Jivraj: Course TA)
We didn‚Äôt account for such cases. The purpose of that form was to reevaluate only those who submitted using their IITM email but had provided the wrong endpoint.
Anyone who didn‚Äôt use their IITM email during submission‚Äîeven if they later filled out the form‚Äîwas filtered out and not considered for reevaluation.

Clarification Regarding Project 2 Reevaluation
Hi Team,
I received an email yesterday stating that our Project 2 would be reevaluated between 11 PM and 2 AM tonight.
However, I haven‚Äôt seen any deployment logs on Railway during that timeframe, and my score on the dashboard is still showing as 0.
My url is working perfectly still there is no logs in the railway.
Could you please confirm whether my Project 2 was actually reevaluated?

Yes, the new page took about 5‚Äì10 seconds to go live after the GitHub repository was created when we used Gmail as a parameter.
If the Gmail is fixed, we can hardcode it in advance.
In our case, Gmail is a parameter, so the function should remain dynamic and it would take 5-10 second to go live after we received answer.

I also accept that we have learnt a lot in this course and marks doesnot matter. but after putting a lot of effort day and night getting a zero, gives a drastic discouragement to even look at the laptop. pls consider if possible.

I have completed and submitted the assigned project 2, and I have verified that it is working correctly as per the given instructions.
However, I noticed that the score awarded to me for the project is 0. I believe this may be an error, as my project meets the required criteria and functions as expected.
I kindly request you to review my submission and let me know if there was any issue during evaluation or submission that may have led to this result.
I have deployed the project on vercel as instructed.
I have uploaded all the links in google form and submitted it.
To support this, I am attaching a screenshot of the PowerShell window that shows an example of my application running successfully for one of the questions.

I appreciate the team incorporating my updated response at the endpoint with the ‚Äú/api‚Äù path and re-evaluating accordingly, as well as sharing the results via email.
To my surprise, when I invoke the same endpoint that was evaluated ‚Äî using the correct multipart/form-data payload with both question and file fields ‚Äî I consistently receive a 200 OK response with the expected output.
Moreover, if I omit either field from the form-data, the server returns the exact validation error mentioned in the re-evaluation report, which makes sense. Based on this behavior and the details in the shared report, I‚Äôd like to confirm: during the re-evaluation, was the request payload indeed sent with both question and file fields included in the form-data?
For reference, I‚Äôve attached a screenshot demonstrating the response.

I would like to highlight an issue regarding the evaluation of the TDS Solver Project 2.
As per the official project instructions, our API was clearly required to handle
POST
requests at /api/ with multipart/form-data.
Nowhere in the documentation was it mentioned that the API should handle
GET
requests.
However, during evaluation, GET requests seem to be made to the endpoint, leading to
405 Method Not Allowed
errors.
These errors are expected behavior for an API that is properly built to accept only POST, exactly as per the project guidelines.
Therefore, I request that the evaluation team
only test using POST requests
as originally instructed.
Penalizing students because of unnecessary GET requests would be
unfair and incorrect
based on the project requirements.
Please ensure that evaluation happens strictly according to the provided instructions.

Case 3: JSON Key Count ‚Äì XF Parameter (GA5_q7)
{
‚Äúapi‚Äù: ‚Äú
https://app.algsoch.tech/api/
‚Äù,
‚Äútest_code‚Äù: ‚ÄúGA5_q7‚Äù,
‚Äústatus‚Äù: ‚ÄúERROR‚Äù,
‚Äúerror‚Äù: ‚Äúinvalid literal for int() with base 10: ‚ÄòError: Invalid JSON in the file. Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)‚Äô‚Äù
}
What Was Expected:
The question required developing a script that:
Parses a large, deeply nested JSON log file, and
Counts how many times a specific key ‚Äî represented by XF ‚Äî appears in the JSON structure.
It was explicitly stated that:
Only key matches for XF are to be counted, not values.
The file to be used was:
E:\data science tool\GA5\q-extract-nested-json-keys.json
What I Did:
I used the correct approach, parsing the nested JSON file and counting how many times the key XF appeared throughout the structure.
Here‚Äôs the actual response I got using this cURL command:
curl -X POST
https://app.algsoch.tech/api/
\
-H ‚Äúaccept: application/json‚Äù \
-F ‚Äúquestion=‚Ä¶How many times does XF appear as a key?‚Äù \
-F ‚Äúfile=@E:\data science tool\GA5\q-extract-nested-json-keys.json‚Äù
API Output:{‚Äúanswer‚Äù:‚Äú14602‚Äù}
This indicates that my logic worked correctly and the key XF appeared 14,602 times, exactly as intended.
What Went Wrong on API Side:
The API returned a parsing error, indicating:
‚Äúinvalid literal for int() with base 10: ‚ÄòError: Invalid JSON in the file‚Ä¶‚Äô‚Äù
However:
My file was valid JSON, properly parsed.
The actual issue seems to be on the API‚Äôs side ‚Äî possibly mishandling the file read or decoding before passing it to the evaluator.
It may have expected an integer but received a string-wrapped error or non-integer data, causing it to crash.
Insight:
If the original question was about counting the key XF, my solution was 100% correct.
However, if the question dynamically changed the key name or added extra criteria (e.g., only count if value == true, or only under a certain section), then the result might differ. But from the default XF-focused question, my logic and result match perfectly.

Good Afternoon Sir.
This is regarding project 1 and project 2.
Project-1 Evaluation
Sir, For the project 1, I have written the code, uploaded in GitHub and the dockerfile image is created and uploaded successfully.
Sir, I already contacted regarding Project - 1, you said to check it by replicating the test environment. I did till running the dockerfile but I needed evaluate.py sir, which I didn‚Äôt get it. I got only 5 marks sir. Can you please check my code once sir and verify it as I have written the code and the dockerfile is running successfully.
Project-2 Evaluation
Regarding project 2 also, I have uploaded my code in GitHub and deployed my app in Vercel. But, I got 0 sir. Can you check my code once again and verify it? According to the guidance given, I deployed my app through Vercel. The app got deployed but I am getting 404 Error, even after trying any troubleshooting method. Maybe, Vercel is in development stage.
Sir, but I wrote the code and deployed, but I got 0 marks only. Please check it and guide me to get it corrected. Sir, due to the projects I got poor marks on TDS. Please, I request you to re-evaluate and give me correct marks.
In anticipation of quick response
Thank You

Hi everyone,
I know that some of you might be feeling anxious about your scores etc. We are currently in the process of validating your scores on all the projects, roe, assignments, exam and bonus, so we will not be able to respond quickly to each individual post here for the time being.
Once we validate, you will receive an email with your official scores that we will be pushing to Operations in a single update. Along with that email you will receive a discrepancy form where you can raise your issues. This will give us a consolidated view of problems and fix them.
Kindly wait for the email to come to you. It will be sent sometime this afternoon.

Furthermore, I have updated my URL using HTTPS via Google Forms, so I kindly request you to consider evaluating my project using the latest URL provided.
This is a humble request, as I am currently at risk of receiving a grade ‚ÄòE‚Äô, which will significantly impact my overall CGPA. As an alternative, I am also willing to retake the course in the next term and pay the fee again if needed.
In the P1, unfortunately scored zero due to a minor mistake and was not given an opportunity to correct it. I truly believe that in real-life scenarios, we are often given chances to rectify such errors, and I sincerely hope for the same consideration here.

https://app.algsoch.tech
What‚Äôs in it for students:
They type their question, and the backend executes the correct solution automatically
Especially helpful for GA preparation, understanding problem logic, and reducing repetitive workload
I‚Äôve made it
free for the first 3 questions
After that, students can access the full platform for just
‚Çπ199/month
, which helps me cover system maintenance and hosting costs
My Humble Request:
This is a tool I‚Äôve built with immense effort and love for this course, and I genuinely believe it can benefit many students.
To sustain the platform ‚Äî hosting, APIs, file management, and backend orchestration ‚Äî I‚Äôve introduced a small paid model after a free trial.
I would be extremely grateful if you could test it once and, if you find it helpful, consider sharing it with upcoming students or mentioning it in a Moodle announcement.
It‚Äôs built
by an IIT Madras student, for IIT Madras students
‚Äî with the sole goal of making their learning smoother, faster, and smarter.
Thank you so much for your time and support.

It‚Äôs a tool built by a fellow IITM student, with deep respect for the academic rigor of this program ‚Äî not to replace learning, but to accelerate it.
Please let me know if you‚Äôd like a walkthrough, or if any suggestions for improvements arise.
