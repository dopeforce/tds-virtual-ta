– please try again after reloading the page. The new error message will be clearer, like this:
Error: At [0].rating: Values don't match. Expected: "7.4". Actual: 7.4
FYI, we expect all values as strings, not numbers. That’s because the year can sometimes be a range for a TV series (e.g. 2021 - 2024) and the rating can sometimes be missing.

[2025-02-02T05:41:42.494Z] Sakthivel S (@23f2000237)
In Question 2, it is specifically said to filter the movies however, the evaluator is expecting a TV show there. Should we also include TV shows now?
edit:  This is an everchanging dataset, so will our answers be saved, as, this json might not be in this order tomorrow?

[2025-02-02T05:45:48.804Z] Anand S (@s.anand: Course_faculty)
@23f2000237
A good point. Yes, please include
all
titles. I’ve reworded the question accordingly. Thanks.

how to get the BBC weather API key?

[2025-02-04T05:47:12.930Z] Joel Jeffrey (@JoelJeffrey)
Just a quick query on the Bonus mark.
Would this be added to the final grade? Say for example, Someone get a full score in the first 4 assignments. So the total comes up to 39.5/39.5, and would be converted to 0.15 or 15 marks. Would the bonus mark be additional to that 15 or would the score change to 40.5/39.5 and then get normalised to 15?

[2025-02-04T06:15:20.501Z] Anand S (@s.anand: Course_faculty)
@JoelJeffrey
It will be added to the GA4 marks, not the final grade. So, it’s roughly worth 0.15% on the total - not a full 1% on the total.

Have a step with your email id as its name. (Instead of checkout repository)
Also make sure you give read and write permission so it commits without any error

Hi Tushar,
If you looked at the PDF you might have realised that students have been grouped. The question gives you a range for the groups 43-66. Including both groups implies both group 43 and 66 are included in your calculation.

In ques 4 Scrap the BBC Weather API,
I scraped the locationId for my city (i.e Mumbai)
and post that also mapped each
issueDate
to its corresponding
enhancedWeatherDescription
.
The sample output mentioned was:
The output would look like this:
{
  "2025-01-01": "Sunny with scattered clouds",
  "2025-01-02": "Partly cloudy with a chance of rain",
  "2025-01-03": "Overcast skies",
  // ... additional days
}
And My Output after scraping (And as explained by professor in Video 2 BBC weather was)
{
“2025-02-05”: “A clear sky and light winds”,
“2025-02-06”: “A clear sky and light winds”,
“2025-02-07”: “A clear sky and light winds”,
“2025-02-08”: “A clear sky and light winds”,
“2025-02-09”: “A clear sky and light winds”,
“2025-02-10”: “A clear sky and light winds”,
“2025-02-11”: “A clear sky and light winds”,
“2025-02-12”: “A clear sky and light winds”,
“2025-02-13”: “A clear sky and light winds”,
“2025-02-14”: “A clear sky and light winds”,
“2025-02-15”: “A clear sky and light winds”,
“2025-02-16”: “A clear sky and light winds”,

“2025-02-18”: “A clear sky and light winds”,
“2025-02-19”: “A clear sky and light winds”
}
But it’s giving Error::

Can you please help how to fix this issue.

In the question no. 10, I have tried numerous time to get it right markdown content but it was incorrect all the time.
I have tried these steps:
import pymupdf4llm
md_text = pymupdf4llm.to_markdown("/content/q-pdf-to-markdown.pdf")

import pathlib
pathlib.Path("output.md").write_bytes(md_text.encode())
Then i run this in bash
prettier --write output.md
And what i got frankly telling was far from this, I did some manual touchups, and this what i have now. This is the best version i could come up with. Saw the preview, it does matches with the pdf.

I think the idea behind this font is to make it difficult for people to manually work on the markdown file from scratch. I guess they want us to use the tools (like PyMuPDF4LLM, markitdown) they provided as resources to convert pdf into a markdown and then may be we can do some manual intervention to make it to the result as the scraping tools are not 100% accurate.
Could be another reason too. TAs’ can feel free to pitch in.

There are only four texts which look like link texts in the pdf.
All four properly coded in link markdown syntax, in the preview, they appear as  link texts same as in pdf.
Link text
Even after chaning all the 4 texts which appered in blue color in the pdf to link texts,
below error is still observed.
Error: Missing links
Did anyone else face same issue ?
Also, no text in the pdf looks like a code block.
But, Missing Code error was seen and after changing one of the paragraph by using markdown code syntax that error is gone.
Appreciate any suggestions on the link error.

Actually, some IMDb titles have multiple names. For example,
The Recruit
is
also known as Graymail in India
. My server checks from a different region from yours. Hence the need for manual corrections for a few titles.
Why didn’t I pick an exercise that could be fully automated?
Because this is how real-life data sourcing is. It’s never perfect. You often need to create workflows where you’re able to quickly correct such errors in automation.

Sir, can I suggest to replace the snapshot of example output which expects the year to be an integer and the ratings as to be floats (instead of actual evaluation which expects them to be strings). Also, it would help to clarify that “Movie 1” should carry the numerical prefix as reported in IMDB.  The current example on the portal is:

Sir, In Graded Assignment - 4 >> Q2, the year I extracted appears as “2024,” whereas the expected value on the portal is “2024–”. I have manually adjusted several values based on the expected format. This issue is specific to the year field.
I use different classes to extract values for various fields. Could there be any other element on the portal affecting this extraction?
In Q4, one of my classmates is encountering a “root property” error despite using the same extraction method as I do. Upon checking, I found that this issue occurs because the city’s time is displayed as the previous day compared to our time. The portal results seem to be based on the city’s actual time rather than IST.
I would appreciate your guidance on these issues.

  { "id": "tt7654321", "title": "Movie 2", "year": "2019", "rating": "6.2" },

I guess for the year part, there are certain series having multiple seasons, for which hyphenated “years” are given.
For the particular instance -
“2024–”
, it appears another season/part is announced, thats why it is written that way.

For this question, you may use the Google Colab file referenced in the assignment. This file will provide you with the date and description. Additionally, you can generate a weather location ID for the city specified in your assignment. Using this ID, you will obtain the weather URL, which you can then use to verify the date and description.

Double-check that the rating field in the JSON is indeed a float (

"2.9"
) in your code.

That is perhaps to ensure we don’t manually write the markdown for the pdf. Converting the pdf to markdown and getting the correct output is extremely hard, I tried doing that multiple times yet wasn’t able to get that right by the original method.
But since it is mentioned that the GAA is hackable and we are allowed to do so, for some of the questions, therefore you can try solving that by establishing a breakpoint in the sources and then write the code in the console to get the expected output.

How to fix this?

you have to manually change for a few mismatch.
s.anand:
@21F1005510
Actually, some IMDb titles have multiple names. For example,
The Recruit
is
also known as Graymail in India
. My server checks from a different region from yours. Hence the need for manual corrections for a few titles.
Why didn’t I pick an exercise that could be fully automated?
Because this is how real-life data sourcing is. It’s never perfect. You often need to create workflows where you’re able to quickly correct such errors in automation.

[2025-02-09T05:52:35.938Z] Shambhavi  (@24f2003130)
Yes …due to the location difference the search results are different for everyone therefore you need to adjust it accordingly
It might need around 6-7 amendments

[2025-02-09T06:13:36.894Z] Shambhavi  (@24f2003130)
The API is returning 14 days of forecast data, as evidenced by the output However, the issueDate values are not unique for each day. Instead, they represent the time when the forecast was issued or updated.
In your output, there are only two unique issueDate values:
2025-02-08T04:00:00-05:00
2025-02-08T16:01:58-05:00
This means the forecast was updated twice on February 8, 2025, once at 04:00 AM and again at 4:01 PM (both in EST timezone) …To get a unique weather description for each day, you  need to modify your approach by using the actual forecast day for each day instead.

While submitting solution, do I need to keep all the local servers running/local URLs like 127.0.0.0 stuff, else I am getting one question as correct & the other one mentions unable to fetch data!? So that means I need to run them in different different ports?

I posted this error message but now the first issue got resolved but I am still keeping it in my post so that if anyone faces same issue, they can try if they can fix it similar to how it worked for me.
Please help with the second issue.
For Q8, the workflow is running on Github and commiting the scraped results to the json file (which is so amazing for me btw!). But I am getting this error for my public repo.
How it got resolved: I set up fixed time for cron schedule instead of every 5 min. Now it works.
Error: No daily scheduled triggers found in workflows.
I had all correct results for Q1 to Q7 till yesterday but it keeps giving errors even when I reload same file for some questions. Do I need to keep addressing those errors or if once correct and saved, I can ignore those?

The error may be due to incorrect loops in your code that’s why it’s going out of range, check for that.

As mentioned in the question, you have to sort by “joined” so it should be “

u have used a apace (_) after 2.9  which is not visible at front that’s why it is throwing error , it should be just (“2.9”) not ("2.9 ")

[2025-02-09T11:09:57.380Z] Koustubh Ramakrishnan (@koustubhr)
Agreed and I have tweaked my approach to get the correct answer. But I feel the question instructions should be adjusted accordingly - the question says to get every issueDate and enhancedweatherDescription key value pair - but only 2 such pairs exist ; whereas in the final answer it is forecast date & weather description total 14  pairs.

Select the ‘Network’ menu.
Select ‘Fetch/XHR’.
Type ‘Karachi’ in the input field on the website.
Do not press Enter
while entering the location; just type the location. Pressing Enter might cause ‘location?api_key=…’ to disappear.
‘location?api_key=…’ will appear in the inspect menu.
Double-click it to open a web page (

first convert it roughly to md file then use ai and tell it to add (all the errors one by one). and slowly it will solve all the errors
yes i know it is not the correct way to convert pdf to md file but its just a way to trick the checking system.
but i have an issue it gave me error that it does not contains the word “bash, javascript, whole  redesign, net, suasoria” which is not in the actual pdf, but i added it and it worked. it was just pure trial and error.

i 'm here for the bonus marks,
But since i am here. Just want to appreciate the course and your efforts towards this.
We need more “teachers” like you, who really puts an extra effort in the course.
And i have never seen any course cool as this,
like appreciating tweaking things, using dev console to tweak things, keep the code checks on client side (
and as S Anand’s Student i have leveraged that freedom
, gave client side answer checks’s code to
o1
and it reverse engineered the minifed code, and lots of question were solved by that only, but really curious on how others are doing this
)
keeping the cutting edge tech in course, like function calling from OpenAI.
(
i have seen some students solutions, they were using regex to solve that problem
)

There is possibly wrong evaluation in q6 as it is taking in 2nd latest link as the correct answer. I might be wrong, but the latest one is giving me incorrect evaluation while the 2nd latest is giving me the correct score.

if you look closely the expected value is
2024-
and actual that you are supplying is
2024
.
Difference ? your value does have a

and a space at the end.
reason ? you might be scraping it ?
trim()
or maybe using
innerText
to get tag’s text ?

Alright so in Q4 of W4, We have to extract weather forecast data from bbc servers for a given city. The city I have been given Nur-Sultan is not present in the bbc data base, it appears the city is now known as Astana and is listed in the bbc database as Astana.
Since Nur-Sultan doesn’t exist in the bbc database, all of my attempts to extract data for it were meet with failure. So I extracted the data for Astana and pasted it in the portal but that doesn’t work as well and throws the following error “TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading ‘id’)”
What am I suppose to do?

Anyone who received the Nur-Sultan parameter for this question and at least attempted it will get a mark.
Kind regards

sir what about bonus marks cuz my score was 9/10 due to q4(Nur-sultan).

[2025-02-11T03:21:36.200Z] Carlton D'Silva (@carlton: Regular)
The bonus mark will be processed afterwards. That is checked before the scores are pushed to portal.

Nominatim API gives me the bounding box of the location. How exactly the bounding box helps me to find the details of the location?

Your most recent score will be considered, as long as you saved it before the deadline

Here are the Discourse IDs that replied to this post.
@carlton
could you please add 1 mark to them in the GA (not the overall score)?
Please include only those are enrolled this term, obviously.
If they didn’t attempt GA4, please include them anyway and give them 1/10.
If they got 10/10 already, please add 1 mark anyway and give them 11/10.

Hello
@s.anand
@carlton
Sir,
As can be seen, my roll number is present in this list (21f2000588) and in GA4 I have got 10/10 but unfortunately, that bonus mark hasn’t been added (as can be seen from the score displayed on the dashboard). So I request you to add that bonus mark to the total kindly.
Hoping for a positive response.
Thanks & Regards
Digvijaysinh Chudasama

I am not saying anything regarding bonus marks. I am asking GA4 q4  about
Nur-Sultan in this question everyone getting error after post in discourse ,sir say who attempt this question get a marks .But i am not recieved this question marks

[2025-02-18T23:42:37.819Z] Sarthak Singh Gaur (@iamsarthak)
if a student has 10/10 and his name is in the bonus list, how would that look like in the dashboard?
I don’t think it is added in my case.

[2025-02-19T06:57:41.395Z] Carlton D'Silva (@carlton: Regular)
It will show up as 110  marks. Bonus marks are for all discourse posts on this thread that Anand has identified as valid. I have provided operations team with the update corrected scores. You will start seeing them in the dashboard soon.
Also these are the list of students that have been affected by Nur-Sultan in their questions. These will get an automatic mark for that question if they attempted it. Note that this is not a bonus mark. This is a free mark.

For those who didn’t submit but still need to practice the questions like to check if the answer is right, or cross-check the solutions for GA 4 and GA 5, is there a special link where the portal just checks the answer and says right or wrong. I wasn’t able to do GA4 or even try to attempt GA 5 before deadline, but i would like to go through the process of submitting etc. is there any link or solutions for GA 4 and GA5.

[2025-02-24T05:46:12.726Z] Andrew David (@23f1002382)
is there anyway to practice the assignments and check answers even though the deadline for the assignment passes? or is the answer given somewhere just for learning sake. I  understand that each set of students get different questions.
